<h2>
<span><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</span>
</h2>

<h3>
<span class="larger">I</span>
</h3>

<p>Two periods of our early history promise most for the future of English
literature—the end of the seventh with the eighth century; the end of
the twelfth century with the thirteenth.</p>

<p>In the first a flourishing vernacular poetry is secondary in importance
to the intellectual accomplishment of men like Bede and Alcuin (to name
only the greatest and the last of a line of scholars and teachers) who,
drawing their inspiration from Ireland and still more from Italy direct,
made all the knowledge of the time their own, and learned to move easily
in the disciplined forms of Latin prose.</p>

<p>During the second the impulse again came from without. In
twelfth-century France the creative imagination was set free. In
England, which from the beginning of the tenth century had depended more
and more on France for guidance, the nobles, clergy, and entertainers,
in whose hands lay the fortunes of literature, had a community of
interest with their French compeers that has never since been
approached. So England shared early in the break with tradition; and
during the thirteenth century the native stock is almost hidden by the
brilliant growth of a new graft.</p>

<p>Every activity of the mind was quickened. A luxuriant invention of forms
distinguished the Gothic style in architecture. All the decorative arts
showed a parallel enrichment. Oxford (at least to insular eyes) was
beginning to rival Paris in learning, and to contribute to the
over-production of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> clerks
which at first extended the province of the
Church, and finally, by breaking the bounds set between ecclesiastics
and laymen, played an important part in the secularization of letters.
The friars, whose foundation was the last great reform of the mediaeval
Church, were at the height of their good fame; and one of them, the
Franciscan Roger Bacon, by his work in philosophy, criticism, and
physical science, raised the name of English thinkers to an eminence
unattained since Bede. If among the older monastic orders feverish and
sometimes extravagant reforms are symptoms of decline, the richness of
Latin chronicles like those of Matthew Paris of St. Albans is evidence
that in some of the great abbeys the monks were still learned and
eloquent. Nor was Latin the only medium in which educated Englishmen
were at home. They wrote French familiarly, and to some extent repaid
their debt to France by transcribing and preserving Continental
compositions that would else have perished.</p>

<p>Apart from all these activities, the manifestations of a new spirit in
English vernacular works are so important, and the break with the past
is so sharp, that the late twelfth century and the thirteenth would be
chosen with more justice than Chaucer's time as the starting-point for a
study of modern literature.</p>

<p>Then romance was established in English, whether we use the word to mean
the imaginative searching of dark places, or in the more general sense
of story-telling unhampered by a too strict regard for facts. Nothing is
more remarkable in pre-Conquest works than the Anglo-Saxon's dislike of
exaggeration and his devotion to plain matter of fact. Here is the
account of the whales in the far North that King Alfred received from
Ohthere (a Norseman, of course, but it is indifferent):—'they are eight
and forty ells long, and the biggest fifty ells long'. Compare with this
parsimony the full-blooded description of the griffins in
<i>Mandeville</i>:—'But o griffoun
hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> the body more gret, and is more
strong, þanne eight lyouns, of suche lyouns as ben o this half; and more
gret and strongere þan an hundred egles suche as we han amonges vs,
&amp;c.', and you have a rough measure of the progress of fiction.</p>

<p>To take pleasure in stories is not a privilege reserved for favoured
generations: but special conditions had transformed this pleasure into a
passion. When Edward I became King in 1272, Western Europe had enjoyed a
long period of internal peace, during which national hatreds burnt low.
The breaking down of barriers between Bretons and French, Welsh and
English, brought into the main stream of European literature the Celtic
vein of idealism and delicate fancy. At the universities, in the
Crusades, in the pilgrimages to Rome or Compostella, the nations
mingled, each bringing from home some contribution to the common stock
of stories; each gaining new experiences of the outside world, fusing
them, and repeating them with embellishments. To those who stayed at
home came the minstrels in the heyday of their craft—they were freemen
of every Christian land who reported whatever was marvellous or
amusing—and at second hand the colours of the rediscovered world seemed
no less brave. It was an age greedy for entertainment that fed a rich
sense of comedy on the jostling life around it; and to serve its ideals
called up the great men of the past—Orpheus opening the way to
fairyland, the heroes of the Trojan war, Alexander; Arthur and the
Knights of the Round Table and Merlin the enchanter; Charlemagne with
his peers—or won back from the shadows not Eurydice alone, but Helen
and Criseyde, Guinevere and Ysolde, Rymenhild and Blauncheflour.</p>

<p>While she still claimed to direct public taste, the Church could not be
indifferent to the spread of romance. A policy of uniform repression was
no longer possible. Her
real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> power to suppress books was ineffective to
bind busy tongues and minds; popular movements were assured of a measure
of practical tolerance when order competed with order and church with
church for the goodwill of the people; and even if the problem had been
well defined, a disciplined attitude unvarying throughout all the
divisions of the Church was not to be expected when her mantle covered
clerks ranging in character from the strictest ascetic to that older
Falstaff who passed under the name of Golias and found his own Muse in
the tavern,—</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Tales versus facio quale vinum bibo;</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Nihil possum scribere nisi sumpto cibo;</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Nihil valet penitus quod ieiunus scribo,—</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Nasonem post calices carmine praeibo!</i></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">So it came about that while some of the clergy denounced all minstrels
as 'ministers of Satan', others made a truce with the more honest among
them, and helped them to add to their repertories the lives of saints.
Officially 'trifles and trotevales' were still censured: but it seemed
good to mould the <i>chansons de geste</i> to pious uses,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and to purify
the court of King Arthur, which popularity had led into dissolute ways,
by introducing the quest of the Graal. And if Rolle preached sound
doctrine when he ranked among the Sins of the Mouth 'to syng seculere
sanges and lufe þam', their style and music were not despised as baits
to catch the ears of the frivolous: when a singer began</p>

<p class="noindent">the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> lover of secular songs would be tempted to listen; but he would stay
to hear a song of the Joys of the Virgin, to whose cult the period owes
its best devotional poetry.</p>

Épiques</i> by Professor Joseph Bédier, 4 vols., Paris 1907-, a book that

of mediaeval literature.</p></div>

<p>The power of the Church to mould the early growth of vernacular
literature is so often manifested that there is a risk of
underestimating the compromises and surrenders which are the signs of
its wane. The figures of romance invaded the churches themselves,
creeping into the carvings of the portals, along the choir-stalls, and
into the historiated margins of the service books. Ecclesiastics
collected and multiplied stories to adorn their sermons or illustrate
their manuals of vices and virtues. In the lives of saints marvels
accumulated until the word 'legend' became a synonym for an untrue tale.
Though there are moments in the fourteenth century when the
preponderance of the clerical over the secular element in literature
seems as great as ever, by the end of the Middle Ages the trend of the
conflict is plain. It is the Church that draws back to attend to her own
defences, which the domestic growth of pious fictions has made
everywhere vulnerable. But imaginative literature, growing always
stronger and more confident, wins full secular liberty.</p>

<p>Emancipation from the bondage of fact, and to some extent from
ecclesiastical censorship, coincided with the acquisition of a new
freedom in the form of English poetry. Old English had a single
metre—the long alliterative line without rime. It was best suited to
narrative; it was unmusical in the sense that it could not be sung; it
had marked proclivities towards rant and noise; and like blank verse it
degenerated easily into mongrel prose.</p>

<p>Degeneration was far advanced in the eleventh century; and about the end
of the twelfth some large-scale experiments show that writers were no
longer content with the old medium. In <i>Layamon</i>, the last great poem in
this metre before the fourteenth century, internal rime and
assonance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
are common. Orm adopted the unrimed <i>septenarius</i> from Latin, but
counted his syllables so faithfully as to produce an intolerable
monotony. Then French influence turned the scale swiftly and decisively
in favour of rime, so that in the extant poetry of the thirteenth
century alliteration is a secondary principle or a casual ornament, but
never takes the place of rime.</p>

<p>The sudden and complete eclipse of a measure so firmly rooted in
tradition is surprising enough; but the wealth and elaborateness of the
new forms that replaced it are still more matter for wonder. It is
natural to think of the poets before Chaucer as children learning their
art slowly and painfully, and often stumbling on the way. Yet in this
one point of metrical technique they seem to reach mastery at a bound.</p>

<p>That the development of verse forms took place outside of English is
part of the explanation. Rimed verse had its origin in Church Latin. In
the monastic schools the theory of classical and post-classical metres
was a principal study; and the practical art of chant was indispensable
for the proper conduct of the services. Under these favourable
conditions technical development was rapid, so that in such an early
example of the rimed stanza as the following, taken from a poem that
Godescalc wrote in exile about the year 845,—</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Magis mihi, miserule,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Flere libet, puerule,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Plus plorare quam cantare</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Carmen tale iubes quale,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Amor care.</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>O, cur iubes canere?</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">the arrangement of longer and shorter lines, the management of rime or
assonance, and the studied grouping of consonant sounds, give rather the
impression of too much than too little artifice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <i>Poetae Latini Aevi Carolini</i>, vol. iii (ed. L. Traube), p.
731.</p></div>

<p>From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> Church Latin rime passed into French, and with the twelfth century
entered on a new course of development at the hands of the <i>trouvères</i>
and the minstrels. The <i>trouvères</i>, or 'makers', studied versification
and music as a profession, and competed in the weaving of ingenious
patterns. Since their living depended on pleasing their audience, those
minstrels who were not themselves composers spared no pains to sing or
recite well the compositions of others; and good execution encouraged
poets to try more difficult forms.</p>

<p>The varied results obtained in two such excellent schools of experience
were offered to the English poets of the thirteenth century in exchange
for the monotony of the long line; and their choice was unhesitating. In
an age of lyrical poetry they learned to sing where before they could
only declaim: and because the great age of craftsmanship had begun, the
most intricate patterns pleased them best. Chaucer was perhaps not yet
born when the over-elaboration of riming metres in English drew a
protest from Robert Mannyng:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and when, after a period of hesitancy,
rimed verse regained its prestige in Chaucer's prime, nameless writers
again chose or invented complex stanza forms and sustained them
throughout long poems. If <i>The Pearl</i> stood alone it might be accounted
a literary <i>tour de force</i>: the York and Towneley plays compel the
conclusion that a high standard of metrical workmanship was appreciated
by the common people.</p>

<p>Thus far, by way of generalization and without the <i>caveats</i> proper to a
literary history, I have indicated some aspects of the preceding period
that are important for an understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
of the fourteenth century. But
it would be misleading to pass on without a word of reservation. There
is reason to suppose that the extant texts from the thirteenth century
give a truer reflection of the tastes of the upper classes, who were in
closest contact with the French, than of the tastes of the people. But
however this may be, they do not authorize us to speak for every part of
the country. All the significant texts come from the East or the
South—especially the western districts of the South, where an
exceptional activity is perhaps to be connected with the old preference
of the court for Winchester. In the North and the North-West a silence
of five centuries is hardly broken.</p>


<hr class="small" />

<h3>
<span class="larger">II</span>
</h3>

<p>Judged by what survives, the literary output of the first half of the
fourteenth century was small in quantity; though it must be remembered
that, unlike the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries which made a fresh
start and depended almost entirely on their own production, the
fourteenth inherited and enjoyed a good stock of verse, to which the new
compositions are a supplement.</p>

<p>Our first impression of this new material is negative and disappointing.
The production of rimed romances falls off: their plots become
increasingly absurd and mechanical; the action, so swift in the early
forms, moves sluggishly through a maze of decorative descriptions; and
their style at its best has the pretty inanity of <i>Sir Thopas</i>. The
succession of merry tales—such as <i>Dame Siriz</i>, or <i>The Fox and the
Wolf</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> where Reynard, Isengrim, and Chauntecleer make their first bow
in English—is broken until the appearance of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>
themselves. To find secular lyrics
we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> must turn to the very beginning
or the very end of the century, and Chaucer himself does not recover the
fresh gaiety of the earlier time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Both are in Bodleian MS. Digby 86 (about 1280), and are
accessible in G. H. McKnight's <i>Middle English Humorous Tales</i>, Boston
1913.</p></div>

<p>The decline of these characteristic thirteenth-century types becomes
less surprising when we notice that literature has changed camps. The
South, more especially the South-West, is now almost silent: the North
and the North-West reach their literary period. Minot and Rolle are
Northerners, Wiclif is a Yorkshireman by birth, the York and Towneley
Miracle cycles are both from the North, and with Barbour the literature
of the Scots dialect begins; Robert Mannyng belongs to the North-East
Midlands; while <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, <i>The Pearl</i>, and <i>The Destruction of
Troy</i> represent the North-West. This predominance in the present volume
rests on no mere chance of selection, since the Northern (Egerton)
version of <i>Mandeville</i> might have been preferred to the Cotton; and if
the number of extracts were to be increased, the texts that first come
to mind—<i>Cursor Mundi</i> (about 1300),<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <i>Prick of Conscience</i> (about
1340), <i>Morte Arthure</i> (about 1360), the Chester Plays—are Northern and
North-Western.</p>

<div class="footnote">

editions are mentioned, the longer works which are not represented by
specimens may be read among the Early English Texts.</p></div>

<p>It is impossible to give more than a partial explanation of the change
in the area of production. But as the kinds of poetry that declined
early in the fourteenth century are those that owed most to French
influence, it is reasonable to assume that in the South the impulse that
produced them had spent its force. The same pause is observable at the
same time in France, where it coincides with the transition from oral
poetry to more reflective compositions written for the eye of a reader.
It is the pause between the passing of the minstrels and the coming of
men of letters.</p>

<p>Such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> changes were felt first in the centres of government, learning, and
commerce, whence ideas and fashions spread very slowly to the country
districts. At this time the North, and above all the North-West, was the
backward quarter of England, thinly populated and in great part
uncultivated. An industrial age had not yet dotted it with inland
cities; and while America was still unknown the western havens were
neglected.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In these old-fashioned parts the age of minstrel poetry
was prolonged, and the wave of inspiration from France, though it came
late, stirred the North and North-West after the South had relapsed into
mediocrity or silence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> See p. 150.</p></div>

<p>So, about the middle of the century, imaginative poetry found a new home
in the West-Midlands. As before, poets turned to French for their
subjects, and often contented themselves with free adaptation of French
romances. They accepted such literary conventions as the Vision, which
was borrowed from the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> to be the frame of <i>Wynnere and
Wastoure</i> (1352)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and <i>The Parlement of the Thre Ages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> before it
was used in <i>Piers Plowman</i> and <i>The Pearl</i> and by Chaucer. But time and
distance had weakened the French influence, and the new school of poets
did not catch, as the Southern poets did, the form and spirit of their
models.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>They preferred the unrimed alliterative verse, which from pre-Conquest
days must have lived on in the remote Western counties without a written
record; and for a generation rime is overshadowed. The suddenness and
importance of this revival in a time otherwise barren of poetry will
appear from a list of the principal alliterative poems that are commonly
assigned to the third quarter of the century:—<i>Wynnere and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
Wastoure</i>,
<i>The Parlement of the Thre Ages</i>, <i>Joseph of Arimathie</i> (the first
English Graal romance), <i>William of Palerne</i>, <i>Piers Plowman</i> (A-text),
<i>Patience</i>, <i>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</i>, <i>The Destruction of
Troy</i>, <i>Morte Arthure</i>.</p>

<p>At the time alliterative verse was fitted to become the medium of
popular literature. Prose would not serve, because its literary life
depends on books and readers. Up to the end of the century (if we
exclude sermons and religious or technical treatises, where practical
considerations reinforced a Latin tradition) the function of prose in
English literature is to translate Latin or French prose;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and even
this narrow province is sometimes invaded by verse. Yet it was not easy
to write verse that depended on number of syllables, quantity, or rime.
The fall of inflexions brought confusion on syllabic metres; there were
great changes in the quantity and quality of vowels; and these
disturbances affected the dialects unevenly.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It must have been hard
enough for a poet to make rules for himself: but popularity involved the
recital of his work by all kinds of men in all kinds of English, when
the rimes would be broken and the rhythm lost. It is perhaps unfair to
call Michael of Northgate's doggerel (p. 33) to witness the misfortunes
of rimed metres. But the text of <i>Sir Orfeo</i> from the Auchinleck
manuscript shows how often Englishmen who were nearly contemporary with
the composer had lost the tune of his verses. The more fortunate makers
of alliterative poems, whose work depended on the stable yet elastic
frame of stress and initial consonants, possessed a master-key to the
dialects.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Chaucer's prose rendering of the <i>Metra</i> of Boethius is an
apparent exception, but Jean de Meung's French prose version lay before
him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See the Appendix.</p></div>

<p>Adaptability made easier the diffusion of alliterative verse: but its
revival was not due to a deliberate choice on practical grounds. It was
a phase of a larger movement, which may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
be described as a weakening of
foreign and learned influences, and a recovery of the native stock. And
the metrical form is only the most obvious of the old-fashioned elements
that reappeared. In spirit, too, the authors of the alliterative school
have many points of kinship with the Old English poets. They are more
moderate than enthusiastic. Left to themselves, their imaginations move
most easily among sombre shapes and in sombre tones. They have not the
intellectual brilliance and the wit of the French poets; and when they
laugh—which is not often—the lightness of the thirteenth century is
rarer than the rough note of the comic scenes in the Towneley plays. It
is hard to say how much the associations and aptitudes of the verse
react on its content: but <i>Sumer is icumen in</i>, which is the essence of
thirteenth-century poetry, is barely conceivable in Old English, where
even the cuckoo's note sounded melancholy; and it would come oddly from
the poets of the middle fourteenth century, who have learned from the
French <i>trouvères</i> the convention of spring, with sunshine, flowers, and
singing birds, but seem unable to put away completely the memory of
winter and rough weather.</p>

<p>In the last quarter of the century the tide of foreign influence runs
strong again; and the work of Gower and Chaucer discloses radical
changes in the conditions of literature which are the more important
because they are permanent. The literary centre swings back to the
capital—London now instead of Winchester—which henceforth provides the
models for authors of any pretensions throughout England and across the
Scottish border. In Chaucer we have for the first time a layman, writing
in English for secular purposes, who from the range and quality of his
work may fairly claim to be ranked among men of letters. The strictly
clerical writers had been content to follow the Scriptures, the Fathers
and commentators, the service books and legendaries; and Chaucer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
does
not neglect their tradition.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The minstrels had exploited a popular
taste for merry tales 'that sownen into synne'; and he borrowed so
gladly from them that many have doubted his repentance.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But his
models are men of letters:—the Latin poets headed by Ovid, who was
Gower's favourite too; French writers, from the satirical Jean de Meung
to makers of studied 'balades, roundels, virelayes' like Machaut and
Deschamps; and the greater Italian group—Boccaccio, Petrarch, and
Dante. Keeping such company, he was bound to reject the rusticity of the
alliterative school, and the middle way followed by those who added a
tag of rime at the end of a rimeless series (as in <i>Sir Gawayne</i>), or
invented stanzas in which alliteration remains, but is subservient to
rime (as in <i>The Pearl</i> and the York plays). After his day, even for
Northerners who wish to write well, there will be no more '<i>rum-ram-ruf</i>
by lettre'.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="larger">III</span>
</h3>


<p>In outlining the main movements of the century, I have mentioned
incidentally the fortunes of certain kinds of composition,—the
restriction of the lyrical form to devotional uses; the long dearth in
the records of humorous tales; the decadence of romances in rime, and
the flourishing of alliterative romances. The popular taste for stories
was still unsatisfied, and guided authors, from Robert Mannyng to
Chaucer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
in their choice of subjects or method of treatment.
Translators were busier than ever in making Latin and French works
available to a growing public who understood no language but English;
and of necessity the greater number of our specimens are translations,
ranging from the crude literalness of Michael of Northgate to the
artistic adaptation seen in Gower's tales. But the chief new
contribution of the century is the vernacular Miracle Play, with which
the history of the English drama begins.</p>

<p>Miracle plays grew out of the services for the church festivals of
Easter and Christmas. Towards the end of the tenth century a
representation of the Three Maries at the Sepulchre is provided for in
the English Easter service. Later, the Shepherds seeking the Manger and
the Adoration of the Magi are represented in the services for the
Christmas season. In their early form these dramatic ceremonies consist
of a few sentences of Latin which were sung by the clergy with a minimum
of dignified action.</p>

<p>From the eleventh to the thirteenth century the primitive form underwent
a parallel development in all parts of Europe. Records of Miracles in
England are at this time scanty and casual:—Matthew Paris notes one at
Dunstable because precious copes were borrowed for it from St. Albans,
and were accidentally burnt; another, given in the churchyard at
Beverley, is mentioned because a boy who had climbed to a post of
vantage in the church, and thence higher to escape the sextons, fell and
yet took no harm. But the scantiness of references before 1200 is in
itself evidence of growth without active enemies, and the few
indications agree with the general trend observable on the Continent.
The range of subjects was extended to include the acts of saints, and
the principal scenes of sacred history from the Fall of Lucifer to the
Last Judgement. Single scenes were elaborated to something like the
scale familiar in Middle English. By the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
of the twelfth century
French begins to appear beside or in place of Latin; the French verses
were spoken, not sung; the plays were often acted outside the church;
and it may be assumed that laymen were admitted as performers alongside
the minor clergy, who seem to have been the staunchest supporters of the
plays.</p>

<p>The Miracle had become popular, and there is soon evidence of its
perversion by the grotesque imaginings of the people. In 1207 masking
and buffoonery in the churches at Christmas came under the ban of Pope
Innocent III, and his prohibition was made permanent in the Decretals.
Henceforth we must look for new developments to the Miracles played
outside the church. To these freedom from the restraints of the sacred
building did not bring a better reputation. Before 1250 the most
influential churchman of the time, Bishop Grosseteste of Lincoln, who
was far from being a kill-joy, urged his clergy to stamp out Miracles;
and later William of Wadington, and Robert Mannyng his translator, while
allowing plays on the Resurrection and the Nativity if decently
presented in the church, condemn the Miracles played in open places, and
blame those of the clergy who encouraged them by lending vestments to
the performers.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>From the first three-quarters of the fourteenth century, which
include the critical period for the English Miracles, hardly a
record survives. The memoranda on which the history of the English
plays is based begin toward the end of the century, and the texts
are drawn from fifteenth- and sixteenth-century manuscripts. Hence
it will be simplest to set out the changes that were complete by
1400 without attempting to establish their true sequence; and to
disregard the existence, side by side with the fully developed
types, of all the gradations between them and the primitive form
that might result from stunted growth or degeneration.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> early references point to the representation of single plays or
small groups of connected scenes; and such isolated pieces survive as
long as there are Miracles: Hull, for instance, specialized on a play of
Noah's Ship. But now we have to record the appearance of series or
cycles of plays, covering in chronological order the whole span of
sacred history. Complete cycles were framed on the Continent as early as
the end of the thirteenth century. In England they are represented by
the York, Towneley (Wakefield), and Chester plays, and the so-called
<i>Ludus Coventriae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There are also records or fragments of cycles
from Beverley, Coventry, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Norwich. The
presentation of the cycle sometimes occupied a day (York), sometimes two
or three successive days (Chester), and sometimes a part was carried
over to the next year's festival (<i>Ludus Coventriae</i>).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> These are not the Coventry plays, of which only two
survive, but a cycle of plays torn from their local connexions (ed. J.
O. Halliwell, Shakespeare Society, 1841). The title is due to a
seventeenth-century librarian, who possibly had heard of no Miracle
cycle but the famous one at Coventry.</p></div>

<p>The production of a long series of scenes in the open requires fine
weather, and once the close connexion with the church services had been
broken, there was a tendency to throw forward the presentation into May
or June. The Chester plays were given in Whitsun-week—at least in later
times. But normally the day chosen in fourteenth-century England was the
Feast of Corpus Christi (the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday), which
was made universal throughout the Church in 1311. So the Miracles get
the generic name of 'Corpus Christi Plays'.</p>

<p>The feature of the Corpus Christi festival was its procession. As a
result either of inclusion in this procession or of imitation, the
cycles came to be played processionally: each play had its stage on
wheels which halted at fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
stations in the streets, and at each
station the play was reenacted. This was the usage at York, Wakefield,
Chester, Coventry, and Beverley. The older practice of presentation on
fixed stages was followed in the <i>Ludus Coventriae</i>.</p>

<p>Our last records from the end of the thirteenth century indicated that
the open-air Miracle had been disowned by the Church from which it
sprang. Yet a century later processional performances appear on a scale
that postulates strong and competent management. In the interim the
control of the great cycles had passed from the clergy to the
municipalities, who laid upon each guild of craftsmen within their
jurisdiction the duty of presenting a play. Ecclesiastics still wrote
Miracles, and occasionally performed them; but when Canterbury, London,
Salisbury, Winchester, Oxford, which have no extant texts and few
records of popular performances, are named against York, Wakefield,
Chester, Coventry, Beverley, it is obvious that official Church
influences were no longer the chief factor in the development of
Miracles. For their growth and survival in England the cycles depended
on the interest of powerful corporations, willing to undertake the
financial responsibility of their production, and able to maintain them
against the attacks of the Lollards, or change of policy in the orthodox
Church, or the fickleness of fashion in entertainment.</p>

<p>The steps by which the English guilds assumed the guardianship of the
plays cannot now be retraced. We must be content to note that the
undertaking called for just that combination of religious duty, civic
patriotism, and pride of craft that inspired the work of the guilds in
their best days. And the clergy had every reason to welcome the
disciplining by secular authority of a wayward offspring that had grown
beyond their own control. The York texts, which bring us nearest to the
time when the corporations and guilds first took charge of the Miracles,
are very creditable to the taste of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
city, and must represent a
reform on the irresponsible productions that scandalized the thirteenth
century. The vein of coarseness in some of the comic scenes of the
Towneley group seems to be due to a later recrudescence of incongruous
elements.</p>

<p>The last great change to be noted was inevitable when the plays became
popular: they were spoken in English and in rimed verse, with only an
occasional tag or stage direction or hymn in Latin to show their origin.
The variety of the texts, and of the modes and purposes of their
representation, make it impossible to assign a date to the transition
that would be generally applicable; and its course was not always the
same. There is an example of direct translation from Latin in the
Shrewsbury fragments,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which contain one actor's cues and parts in
three plays: first the Latin foundation is given in verse or prose, and
then its expansion in English alternate rime. That translations were
sometimes made from the French is proved by the oldest known manuscript
of a Miracle in English—an early fourteenth-century fragment of a
Nativity play, consisting of a speech in French followed by its
rendering in the same stanza form.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But there is no reason to doubt
that as English gained ground and secularization became more complete,
original composition appeared side by side with translation.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
one other kind of writing the fourteenth century is notable—its
longer commentaries on contemporary life and the art of living. In the
twelfth century England had an important group of satirical poets who
wrote in Latin; and in the thirteenth there are many French and a few
English satires. Their usual topic was the corruption of the religious
orders, varied by an occasional attack on some detail of private folly,
such as extravagance in dress or the pride of serving-men. These pieces
are mostly in the early French manner, where so much wit tempers the
indignation that one doubts whether the satirist would be really happy
if he succeeded in destroying the butts of his ridicule.</p>

<p>This is not the spirit of the fourteenth century, when a darker side of
life is turned up and reported by men whose eyes are not quick to catch
brightness. The number of short occasional satires in English increases,
but they are seldom gay. The greater writers—Rolle, Wiclif, Langland,
Gower—were obsessed by the troubles of their time, and are less
satirists than moralists. Certainly the events of the century gave
little cause for optimism. The wane of enthusiasm throughout Europe and
the revival of national jealousies are evident very early in the failure
of all attempts to organize an effective Crusade after 1291, when the
Turks conquered the last Christian outposts in Palestine. There was no
peace, for the harassing wars with Scotland were followed by the long
series of campaigns against France that sapped the strength of both
countries for generations. The social and economic organization was
shaken by the severest famines (1315-21) and the greatest pestilence
(1349) in English history, and both famine and plague came back more
than once before the century was done. The conflict of popes and
anti-popes divided the Western Church, while England faced the domestic
problem of Lollardry. There was civil revolt in 1381; and the century
closed with the deposition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Richard II. A modern historian balances
the account with the growth of parliamentary institutions, the improving
status of the labouring classes, and the progress of trade: but in so
far as these developments were observable at all by contemporary
writers, they were probably interpreted as signs of general decay.</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere the serene temper with which Robert Mannyng
handles the sins and follies of his generation did not last long. Rolle
tried to associate with men in order to improve their way of life: but
his intensely personal attitude towards every problem, and the low value
he set on the quality of reasonableness, made success impossible; and
after a few querulous outbursts against his surroundings, he found his
genius by withdrawing into pure idealism.</p>

<p>Wiclif was the one writer who was also a practical reformer. Having made
up his mind that social evils could be remedied only through the Church,
and that the first step was a thorough reform of the government,
doctrine, and ministers of the Church, he acted with characteristic
logic. The vices and follies of the people he regarded as secondary, and
refused to dissipate his controversial energies upon them. His strength
was reserved for a grim, ordered battle against ecclesiastical abuses;
and while he pulled down, he did not neglect to lay foundations that
outlasted his own defeat.</p>

<p><i>Piers Plowman</i> gives a full picture of the times and their bewildering
effect on the mind of a sincere and moderate man. Its author belonged to
the loosely organized secular clergy who, by reason of their middle
position, served as a kind of cement in a ramshackle society. He has no
new system and no practical schemes of reform to expound—only
perplexing dreams of a simple Christian who, with Conscience and Reason
as his guides, faces in turn the changing shapes of evil. He attacks
them bravely enough, and still they seem to evade him; because he
shrinks from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
destroying their roots when he finds them too closely
entwined with things to which his habits or affections cling. In the end
he cannot find a sure temporal foothold: yet he has no vision of a
Utopia to come in which society will be reorganized by men's efforts.
That idea brought no comfort to his generation who, standing on the
threshold of a new order, looked longingly backward.</p>

<p>Passing over Gower, whose direct studies of contemporary conditions were
written in Latin and French, we come round again to Chaucer. He has not
Rolle's idealism, or Wiclif's fighting spirit, or Langland's
earnestness—in fact, he has no great share of moral enthusiasm. A man
of the world with keen eyes and the breadth of outlook and sympathy that
Gower lacked, he is at home in a topsy-turvy medley of things half-dead
with things half-grown, and the thousand disguises of convention and
propriety through which the new life peeped to mock at its puzzled and
despairing repressors were to him a never-ending entertainment. <i>Ubique
iam abundat turpitudo terrena</i>, says Rolle in an alliterative flight,
<i>vilissima voluptas in viris vacillat;... bellant ut bestiae; breviantur
beati; nullus est nimirum qui nemini non nocet</i>. That was one side, but
it was not the side that interested Chaucer. He had the spirit of the
thirteenth-century poets grown up, with more experience, more
reflection, and a mellower humour, but not less good temper and capacity
for enjoyment. He no longer laughs on the slightest occasion for sheer
joy of living: but he would look elvishly at Richard Rolle—a hermit who
made it a personal grievance that people left him solitary, a fugitive
from his fellows who unconsciously satisfied a very human and pleasing
love for companionship and admiration by becoming the centre of a
coterie of women recluses. A world that afforded such infinite amusement
to a quiet observer was after all not a bad place to live in.</p>

<span class="larger">IV</span>
</h3>

<p>Chaucer, who suffers when read in extracts, is not represented in this
book, although without him fourteenth-century literature is a body
without a head. But in the choice of literary forms and subjects, I have
aimed at illustrating the variety of interest that is to be found in the
writings of lesser men.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether the choice of specimens gives a true idea of the
taste and accomplishment of the age. This issue is raised by Professor
Carleton Brown's Afterword in the second volume of his <i>Register of
Middle English Religious and Didactic Verse</i>, a book that will be to
generations of investigators a model of unselfish research. There he
emphasizes the popularity of long poems, and especially of long didactic
poems, as evidenced by the relatively great number of manuscript copies
that survive. <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> leads with ninety-nine
manuscripts, against sixty-nine of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, and
forty-seven of <i>Piers Plowman</i>. What is to be said of a book that,
impoverished by the exclusion of Chaucer, passes by also the most
popular poem of his century?</p>

<p>I would rest an apology on the conditions under which manuscript copies
came into being and survived; and begin with Michael of Northgate as he
brings his <i>Ayenbyte</i> to an end in the October of 1340, before the short
days and the numbing cold should come to make writing a pain. The book
has no elegance that would commend it to special care, for Dan Michael
is a dry practical man, as indifferent to the graces of style as to the
luxury of silky vellum and miniatures stiff with gold and colour. But
from his cell it goes into the library of his monastery—a library well
ordered and well catalogued, and (as if to guarantee security) boasting
the continuous possession of books that Gregory the Great gave to the
first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
missionaries. We know its place exactly—the fourth shelf of
press XVI. And there it remained safe until the days of intelligent
private collectors, passing finally with the Arundel library to the
British Museum. The course was not often so smooth, for of two dozen
manuscripts left by Michael to St. Augustine's, Dr. James, in the year
1903, could identify only four survivors in as many different libraries.
But the example is enough to illustrate a proposition that will not
easily be refuted:—the chances of an English mediaeval manuscript
surviving greatly depend on its eligibility for a place in the library
of a religious house, since these are the chief sources of the
manuscripts that have come down to us.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Church towards the vernacular literature of the
later Middle Ages did not differ materially from her attitude towards
the classics in earlier times, though the classics had always the
greater dignity. Literary composition as a pure art was not encouraged.
Entertainment for its own sake was discountenanced. The religious houses
were to be centres of piety and learning; and if English were admitted
at all in the strongholds of Latin and French, a work of unadorned
edification like <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> would make very suitable
reading for those who craved relaxation from severer studies. There
were, of course, individuals among the professed religious who indulged
a taste for more worldly literature; but the surviving catalogues of
libraries that were formed under the eye of authority show a marked
discrimination in favour of didactic works.</p>

<p>In England the private libraries of fourteenth-century laymen were
relatively insignificant. But Guy, Earl of Warwick, in 1315 left an
exceptionally rich collection to the Abbey of Bordesley, which failed to
conserve the legacy. The list was first printed in Todd's <i>Illustrations
of Gower and Chaucer</i> (1810),<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and (among devotional works and lives
of saints that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
merge into religious romances like <i>Joseph of Arimathea and the Graal</i>, <i>Titus and Vespasian</i>, and <i>Constantine</i>) it includes
most of the famous names of popular history:—Lancelot, Arthur and
Modred; Charlemagne, Doon of Mayence, Aimery of Narbonne, Girard de
Vienne, William of Orange, Thibaut of Arraby, Doon of Nanteuil, Guy of
Nanteuil, William Longespée, Fierebras; with two Alexander romances, a
<i>Troy Book</i>, a <i>Brut</i>; the love story of <i>Amadas e Idoine</i>; the romance
<i>de Guy e de la Reygne 'tut enterement'</i>; a book of physic and surgery;
and a miscellany—<i>un petit rouge livere en lequel sount contenuz mous
diverses choses</i>. Yet even a patron so well disposed to secular poems
did little to perpetuate the manuscripts of English verse. His education
enabled him to draw from the fountain head, and most of his books were
French.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> p. 161.</p></div>

<p>Neither in the libraries of the monasteries, nor in the libraries of the
great nobles, should we expect to find a true mirror of popular taste.
The majority of the people knew no language but English; and the
relative scarcity of books of every kind, which even among the educated
classes made the hearers far outnumber the readers, was at once a cause
and a symptom of illiteracy: the majority of the people could not read.
This leads to a generalization that is cardinal for every branch of
criticism:—up to Chaucer's day, the greater the popularity of an
English poem, the less important becomes the manuscript as a means of
early transmission. The text, which would have been comparatively safe
in the keeping of scribe, book, and reader, passes to the uncertain
guardianship of memorizer, reciter, and listener; so that sometimes it
is wholly lost, and sometimes it suffers as much change in a generation
as would a classical text in a thousand years. Already Robert Mannyng
laments the mutilation of <i>Sir Tristrem</i> by the 'sayers' (who could
hardly be expected to avoid faults of improvisation and omission in the
recitation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
<i>so long a poem from memory);<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and his regret would</i>
have been keener if he could have looked ahead another hundred years to
see how the texts of the verse romances paid the price of popularity by
the loss of crisp phrases and fresh images, and the intrusion of every
mode of triteness.</p>

  the excellence of which Petrarch remarks in his account of the

<p>Of course manuscripts of the longer secular poems were made and
used,—mean, stunted copies from which the travelling entertainer could
refresh his memory or add to his stock of tales; fair closet copies that
would enable well-to-do admirers to renew their pleasure when no skilled
minstrel was by; and, occasionally, compact libraries of romance, like
the Auchinleck manuscript, which must have been the treasure of some
great household that enjoyed 'romanz-reding <i>on þe bok</i>'—the pastime
that encouraged the rise of prose romances in the late Middle Ages. But
as a means of circulation for popular verse, as distinct from learned
verse and from prose, the book was of secondary importance in its own
time, and was always subject to exceptional risks. The fates of three
stories in different kinds, all demonstrably favourites in the
fourteenth century, will be sufficient illustration: of <i>Floris and
Blauncheflour</i>, one of the best of the early romances in the courtly
style,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
several manuscripts survive, but when all are assembled the
beginning of the story is still wanting; of <i>Havelok</i>, typical of the
homely style, one imperfect copy and a few charred fragments of another
are extant; of the <i>Tale of Wade</i>, that was dear to 'olde wydwes',<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and yet considered worthy to entertain the noble Criseyde,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> no text
has come down. Evidently, to determine the relative popularity of the
longer tales in verse we need not so much a catalogue of extant
manuscripts, as a census, that cannot now be taken, of the repertories
of the entertainers.</p>

<p>If the manuscript life of the longer secular poems was precarious, the
chances of the short pieces—songs, ballads, jests, comic dialogues,
lampoons—were still worse. Since they were composed for the day without
thought of the future, and were no great charge on the ordinary memory,
the chief motives for writing them down were absent; and no doubt the
professional minstrel found that to secure his proprietary rights
against competitors, he must be chary of giving copies of his best
things. Many would never be put into writing; some were jotted down on
perishable wax; but parchment, always too expensive for ephemeral verse,
was reserved for special occasions. In France, in the thirteenth
century, Henri d'Andeli adds a touch of dignity to his poem celebrating
the memory of a distinguished patron by inscribing it on parchment
instead of the wax tablets he used for lighter verses.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>

book containing many divers things'—in which early collectors noted
down the scraps that interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
them. A codex of West-Country origin,
MS. Harley 2253 in the British Museum, preserves among French poems such
as the complaint of the <i>Trailebastoun</i>, a group of English songs that
includes <i>Lenten is Come</i> and <i>Alysoun</i>. Most of its numbers are unique,
and the loss of this one volume would have swept away the best part of
our knowledge of the early Middle English secular lyrics.</p>

<p>Of survival by quotation there is an example in the history of the
Letter of Theodric, which lies behind Mannyng's tale of the Dancers of
Colbek; and the circumstances are worth lingering over both for the
number of by-paths they open to speculation, and for the glimpse they
give of Wilton in a century from which there are few records of the
nunnery outside the grim, tax-gatherer's entries of Domesday.</p>

<p>In the year before the Conquest, Theodric the foreigner, still racked by
the curse that was laid on Bovo's company, made his way from the court
of Edward the Confessor to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
the shrine of St. Edith. As he walked through
the quiet valley to Wilton in the spring of the year, we may be sure the
thought came to him that here at last was the spot where a man wearied
with wandering from land to land, from shrine to shrine, might hope to
be cured and to set up his rest. From the moment he reaches the abbey it
is impossible not to admire his feeling for dramatic effect. By a
paroxysm of quaking he terrifies the peasants; but to the weeping nuns
he tells his story discreetly; and, lest a doubt should remain, produces
from his scrip a letter in which St. Bruno, the great Pope Leo IX,
vouches for all. It is notable that at this stage the convent appear to
have taken no steps to record a story so marvellous and so well
authenticated; and had Theodric continued his restless wandering we
should know of him as little as is known of three others from the band
of carollers, who had preceded him at Wilton with a similar story. But
when he obtains leave to sleep beside the shrine of St. Edith, and in
the morning of the great feast of Lady Day wakes up healed, exalting the
fame of their patron saint who had lifted the curse where all the saints
of Europe had failed, then, and then only, the convent order that an
official record should be made, and the letter copied: <i>Hec in presencia
Brichtive ipsius loci abbatisse declarata et patriis litteris<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> sunt
mandata</i>. Henceforth it exists only as a chapter in the Acts of St.
Edith, and as such it lay before Robert of Brunne. Of the other
communities or private persons visited by Theodric (who, whether saint
or <i>faitour</i>, certainly did not produce his letter for the first and
last time at Wilton) none have preserved his memory. It would be hard to
find a better example of the power of the clergy in early times to
control the keys to posterity, or of the practical considerations which,
quite apart from merit or curiosity, governed the preservation of
legends.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Patriis litteris</i> according to Schröder and Gaston Paris
means 'English language', but if it is not a mere flourish, it means
rather the 'English script' in which the Latin letter was copied, as
distinct from the foreign hand of Theodric's original letter. What
'English script' meant at Wilton in 1065 is a question of some delicacy.
The spelling <i>Folcpoldus</i> for <i>Folcwoldus</i> in some later copies of the
Wilton text must be due to confusion of <i>p</i> and Anglo-Saxon
ƿ = <i>w</i>. This would be decisive for 'Anglo-Saxon script' if it occurred
anywhere but in a proper name.</p></div>

<p>But it is the verses casually jotted down in unrelated books that bring
home most vividly the slenderness of the thread of transmission. A
student has committed <i>Now Springs the Spray</i> to solitary imprisonment
between the joyless leaves of an old law book. The song of the Irish
Dancer and <i>The Maid of the Moor</i> were scribbled, with some others from
a minstrel's stock, on the fly-leaf of a manuscript now in the Bodleian.
On a blank page of another a prudent man (who used vile ink, long since
faded) has written the verses that banish rats, much as a modern
householder might treasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
up some annihilating prescription. To these
waifs the chance of survival did not come twice, and to a number
incalculable it never came.</p>

<p>It has been the purpose of this digression to bring the extant
literature into perspective: not to raise useless regrets for what is
lost, since we can learn only from what remains; nor to contest the
value of statistics of surviving copies as a proof of circulation,
provided the works compared are similar in length and kind, and are
represented in enough manuscripts to make figures significant; nor yet
to deny that didactic verse bulks large in the output of the fourteenth
century: it could not be otherwise in an anxious age, when the scarcity
of remains gives everything written in English a place in literary
history, and when for almost everything verse was preferred to prose. It
seemed better to redress the balance of chance by stealing from the end
of the thirteenth century a few fragments that following generations
would not forget, than to lend colour to the suggestion that ninety-nine
of the men of Chaucer's century enjoyed <i>The Prick of Conscience</i> for
every one that caught up the refrain of <i>Now Springs the Spray</i>, or
danced through <i>The Maid of the Moor</i>, or sang the praises of Alison.</p>

<p>However much a maker of excerpts may stretch his commission to give
variety, it is in vain if the reader will not do his part; for it lies
with him to find interest. Really no effective attack can be made on a
crust of such diversified hardness until the reader looks at his text as
a means of winning back something of the life of the past, and feels a
pleasure in the battle against vagueness.</p>

<p>The first step is to find out the verbal meaning. Strange words, that
force themselves on the attention and are easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
found in dictionaries
and glossaries, try a careful reader less than groups of common
words—such lines as</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Þe fairest leuedi, for þe nones,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Þat miȝt gon on bodi and bones</i>  <span class="indent2"> <span class="smaller">II</span> 53-4</span></p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">which, if literally transposed into modern English, are nonsense. Those
who think it is beneath the dignity of an intelligent reader to weigh
such gossamer should turn to Zupitza's commentary on the Fifteenth
Century Version of <i>Guy of Warwick</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and see how a master among
editors of Middle English relishes every phrase, missing nothing, and
yet avoiding the opposite fault of pressing anything too hard. For these
tags, more or less emptied of meaning through common use, and ridiculous
by modern standards, have their importance in the economy of spoken
verse, where a good voice carried them off. They helped out the composer
in need of a rime; the reciter on his feet, compelled to improvise; and
the audience who, lacking the reader's privilege to linger over
close-packed lines, welcomed familiar turns that by diluting the sense
made it easier to receive.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Early English Text Society, extra series, 1875-6.</p></div>

<p>Repeated reading will bring out clearly the formal elements of
style—the management of rime and alliteration in verse, the grouping
and linking of clauses in prose, the cadences in both verse and prose:
and before the value of a word or phrase can be settled it is often
necessary to inquire how far its use was dictated by technical
conditions, compliance with which is sometimes ingenuous to the point of
crudity. Where a prose writer would be content with <i>Mathew sayth</i>, an
alliterative poet elaborates (<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 234) into:</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Mathew with mannes face mouthed þise wordis</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and in such a context <i>mouthed</i> cannot be pressed. The frequent oaths in
the speeches in <i>Piers Plowman</i> are no more than counters in the
alliteration: being meaningless they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
are selected to prop up the verse,
just as the barrenest phrases in the poem <i>On the Death of Edward III</i>
owe their inclusion to the requirements of rime. Again, it will be
easier to acquiesce in a forced sense of <i>bende</i> in</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>On bent much baret bende</i>       <span class="indent2"><span class="smaller">V</span> 47</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">when it is observed that rime and alliteration so limit the poet's
choice that no apter word could be used. Conversely, in the absence of
disturbing technical conditions, a reader who finds nonsense should
suspect his understanding of the text, or the soundness of the text,
before blaming the author.</p>

<p>When the sense expressed and the methods of expression have been
studied, it remains to examine the implications of the words—an endless
task and perhaps the most entertaining of all. Take as a routine example
the place where the Green Knight, preparing a third time to deliver his
blow, says to Gawayne—</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Halde þe now þe hyȝe hode þat Arþur þe raȝt,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>And kepe þy kanel at þis kest, ȝif hit keuer may</i>     <span class="indent2"> <span class="smaller">V</span>  229 f.</span></p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">A recent translator renders very freely:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">'but yet thy hood up-pick,</p>
<p class="verse">Haply 'twill cover thy neck when I the buffet strike'—</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">though the etiquette of decapitation, and the delicacy of the stroke
that the Green Knight has in mind, require just the opposite
interpretation:—Gawayne's hood has become disarranged since he bared
his neck (<span class="smaller">V</span> 188), and the Green Knight wants a clear view to make sure
of his aim. An observation of Gaston Paris on the Latin story of the
Dancers of Colbek will show how much an alert mind enriches the reading
of a text with precise detail. From the incident of Ave's arm he
concludes that the dancers did not form a closed ring, but a line with
Bovo leading (<span class="smaller">I</span> 55) and Ave, as the last comer (<span class="smaller">I</span> 43-54), at its end, so
that she had one arm free which her brother seized in his attempt to
drag her away (<span class="smaller">I</span> 111 ff.).</p>

<p>Intensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span> reading should be combined with discursive. Intensive reading
cultivates the habit of noticing detail; and it is a sound rule of
textual criticism to interpret a composition first in the light of the
evidence contained within itself. For instance, the slight flicker in
the verse</p>


<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Sche most wiþ him no lenger abide</i>     <span class="indent2"><span class="smaller">II</span> 330</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">should recall as surely as a cross-reference the earlier line</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>No durst wiþ hir no leng abide</i>    <span class="indent2"> <span class="smaller">II</span> 84</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and raise the question whether in both places in the original work the
comparative had not the older form <i>leng</i>. Discursive reading is a
safeguard against the dangers of a narrow experience, and especially
against the assumption that details of phrase, style, or thought are
peculiar to an author or composition, when in fact they are common to a
period or a kind. A course of both will enable the reader to cope with a
school of critics who rely on superficial resemblances to strip the mask
from anonymous authors and attach their works to some favoured name.
Whether <i>Sir Gawayne</i> and <i>The Destruction of Troy</i> are from the same
hand is still seriously debated. Both are alliterative poems; but it is
impossible to read ten lines from each aloud without realizing the wide
gap that divides their rhythms. The differences of spirit are more
radical still. The facility of the author of <i>The Destruction</i> is
attained at the cost of surrender to the metre. Given pens, ink, vellum,
and a good original, he could go on turning out respectable verses while
human strength endured. And because his meaning is all on the surface,
the work does not improve on better acquaintance. The author of <i>Sir
Gawayne</i> is an artist who never ceases to struggle with a harsh medium.
He has the rare gift of visualizing every scene in his story: image
succeeds image, each so sharply drawn as to suggest that he had his
training in one of the schools of miniature-painting for which early
England was famous. It is this gift of the painter that, more than
likeness of dialect or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
juxtaposition in the manuscript, links <i>Sir Gawayne</i> with <i>The Pearl</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly urged that the purpose of a worker in Middle
English should be nothing less than to read sensitively, with the
fullest possible understanding. Of such a purpose many <i>curricula</i> give
no hint. Nor could it be deduced readily from the latest activities of
research, where the tendency is more and more to leave the main road
(which should be crowded if the study is to thrive) for side-tracks and
by-paths of side-tracks in which the sense of direction and proportion
is easily lost.</p>

<p>That much may be accomplished by specialists following a single line of
approach has been demonstrated by the philologists, who have burrowed
tirelessly to present new materials to a world which seldom rewards
their happiest elucidations with so much as a 'Well said, old mole!' The
student of literature (in the narrower modern sense of the word) brings
a new range of interests. He will be disappointed if he expects to find
a finished art, poised and sustained, in an age singularly afflicted
with growing pains; but there are compensations for any one who is
content to catch glimpses of promise, and—looking back and forward, and
aside to France—to take pleasure in tracing the rise and development of
literary forms and subjects. It is still not enough. The specialist in
language as a science, or in literature as an art, may find the Sixth
Passus of <i>Piers Plowman</i> (<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i>) or the Wiclifite
<i>sermon</i> (<span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i>) of
secondary interest. Yet both are primary documents, the one for the
history of society, the other for the history of religion.</p>

<p>There is no escape from a counsel of perfection:—whoever enters on a
course of mediaeval studies must reckon as a defect his lack of interest
in any side of the life of the Middle Ages; and must be deaf to those
who, like the fox in Aesop that had lost its tail, proclaim the benefits
of truncation. The range of knowledge and experience was then more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
than
in later times within the compass of a single mind and life. And so much
that is necessary to a full understanding has been lost that no possible
source of information should be shut out willingly. It is an exercise in
humility to call up in all its details some scene of early English life
(better a domestic scene than one of pageantry) and note how much is
blurred.</p>

<p>Every blur is a challenge. There are few familiar subjects in which a
beginner can sooner reach the limits of recorded knowledge. The great
scholars have found time to chart only a fraction of their discoveries;
and the greatest could not hope or wish for a day when the number of
quests worth the making would be appreciably less.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This book had its origin in a very different project. Professor Napier
had asked me to join him in producing for the use of language students a
volume of specimens from the Middle English dialects, with an apparatus
strictly linguistic. The work had not advanced beyond the choice of
texts when his death and my transfer to duties in which learning had no
part brought it to an end. When later the call came for a book that
would introduce newcomers to the fourteenth century, I was able to bring
into the changed plan his favourite passage from <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, and to
draw upon the notes of his lectures for its interpretation. It is a
small part of my debt to the generous and modest scholar whose mastery
of exact methods was an inspiration to his pupils.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>I am obliged to the Early English Text Society and to the Clarendon
Press for permission to use extracts from certain of their publications;
to the librarians who have made their manuscripts available, or have
helped me to obtain facsimiles; to Mr. J. R. R. Tolkien who has
undertaken the preparation of the Glossary, the most exacting part of
the apparatus; and to Mr. Nichol Smith who has watched over the book
from its beginnings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="larger">THE TEXTS</span>
</h3>

<p>A single manuscript is chosen as the basis of each text, and
neither its readings nor its spellings are altered if they can
reasonably be defended. Where correction involves substitution,
the substituted letters are printed in italics, and the actual
reading of the manuscript will be found in the Footnotes (or
occasionally in the Notes). Words or letters added to complete the
manuscript are enclosed in caret brackets &lt; &gt;. Corrupt readings
retained in the text are indicated by daggers ††.
Paragraphing, punctuation, capitals, and the details of word
division are modern, and contractions are expanded without notice,
so that the reader shall not be distracted by difficulties that
are purely palaeographical. A final <i>e</i> derived from OFr. <i>é(e)</i>
or <i>ie</i>, OE. <i>-ig</i>, is printed <i>é</i>, to distinguish it from
unaccented final <i>e</i> which is regularly lost in Modern English.</p>

<p>The extracts have been collated with the manuscripts, or with complete
photographs, except Nos. <span class="smaller">IV</span>  (Thornton MS.),
<span class="smaller">VII</span>, <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i>, <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span>,
the manuscripts of which I have not been able to consult. The Footnotes
as a rule take no account of conjectural emendations, variants from
other manuscripts, or minutiae like erasures and corrections
contemporary with the copy.</p>

<span>ROBERT MANNYNG OF BRUNNE'S HANDLYNG SYNNE</span>
<span class="smaller"><small>A.D.</small> 1303</span>
</h2>


<p>What is known of Robert Mannyng of Brunne is derived from his own works.
In the Prologue to <i>Handlyng Synne</i> he writes:</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">To alle Crystyn men vndir sunne,</p>
<p class="verse">And to gode men of Brunne,</p>
<p class="verse">And speciali, alle be name,</p>

<p class="verse">Syxe myle besyde Sympryngham euene,</p>
<p class="verse">Y dwelled yn þe pryorye</p>
<p class="verse">Fyftene ȝere yn cumpanye....</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And in the Introduction to his <i>Chronicle</i>:</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">Of Brunne I am; if any me blame,</p>
<p class="verse">Robert Mannyng is my name;</p>
<p class="verse">Blissed be he of God of heuene</p>
<p class="verse">Þat me Robert with gude wille neuene!</p>
<p class="verse">In þe third Edwardes tyme was I,</p>
<p class="verse">When I wrote alle þis story,</p>

<p class="verse">Danȝ Robert of Malton, þat ȝe know,</p>
<p class="verse">Did it wryte for felawes sake</p>
<p class="verse">When þai wild solace make.</p>

</div>

<p>From these passages it appears that he was born in Brunne, the modern
Bourn, in Lincolnshire; and that he belonged to the Gilbertine Order.
Sempringham was the head-quarters of the Order, and the dependent priory
of Sixhill was near by. It has been suggested, without much evidence,
that he was a lay brother, and not a full canon.</p>

<p>His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_002">[002]</a></span> <i>Chronicle of England</i> was completed in 1338. It falls into two
parts, distinguished by a change of metre and source. The first, edited
by Furnivall in the Rolls Series (2 vols. 1887), extends from the Flood
to <small>A.D.</small> 689, and is based on Wace's <i>Brut</i>, the French source of
Layamon's <i>Brut</i>. The second part, edited by Hearne, 2 vols., Oxford
1725, extends from <small>A.D.</small> 689 to the death of Edward I, and is based on
the French <i>Chronicle</i> of a contemporary, who is sometimes called Pierre
de Langtoft, sometimes Piers of Bridlington, because he was a native of
Langtoft in Yorkshire, and a canon of the Austin priory at Bridlington
in the same county. Mannyng's <i>Chronicle</i> has no great historical value,
and its chief literary interest lies in the references to current
traditions and popular stories.</p>

<p><i>Handlyng Synne</i> is a much more valuable work. It was begun in 1303:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">Dane Felyp was mayster þat tyme</p>
<p class="verse">Þat y began þys Englyssh ryme;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The source was again a French work written by a contemporary
Northerner—William of Wadington's <i>Manuel de Pechiez</i>. The popularity
of such treatises on the Sins may be judged from the number of works
modelled upon them: e.g. the <i>Ayenbyte of Inwyt</i>, Gower's <i>Confessio
Amantis</i>, and Chaucer's <i>Parson's Tale</i>. Their purpose was, as Robert
explains, to enable a reader to examine his conscience systematically
and constantly, and so to guard himself against vice.</p>

<p>Two complete MSS. of <i>Handlyng Synne</i> are known: British Museum MS.
Harley 1701 (about 1350-75), and MS. Bodley 415, of a slightly later
date. An important fragment is in the library of Dulwich College. The
whole text, with the French source, has been edited by Furnivall for the
Roxburghe Club, and later for the Early English Text Society. It treats,
with the usual wealth of classification, of the Commandments, the Sins,
the Sacraments, the Requisites and Graces of Shrift. But such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_003">[003]</a></span>
a bald
summary gives no idea of the richness and variety of its content. For
Mannyng, anticipating Gower, saw the opportunities that the illustrative
stories offered to his special gifts, and spared no pains in their
telling. A few examples are added from his own knowledge. More often he
expands Wadington's outlines, as in the tale of the Dancers of Colbek.
Here the French source is brief and colourless. But the English
translator had found a fuller Latin version—clearly the same as that
printed from Bodleian MS. Rawlinson C 938 in the preface to Furnivall's
Roxburghe Club edition—and from it he produced the well-rounded and
lively rendering given below.</p>

<p>Robert knew that a work designed to turn 'lewde men' from the ale-house
to the contemplation of their sins must grip their attention; and in the
art of linking good teaching with entertainment he is a master. He has
the gift of conveying to his audience his own enjoyment of a good story.
His loose-knit conversational style would stand the test of reading
aloud to simple folk, and he allows no literary affectations, no forced
metres or verbiage, to darken his meaning:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">Haf I alle in myn Inglis layd</p>
<p class="verse">In symple speche as I couthe,</p>
<p class="verse">Þat is lightest in mannes mouthe.</p>
<p class="verse">I mad noght for no disours,</p>
<p class="verse">Ne for no seggers, no harpours,</p>
<p class="verse">But for þe luf of symple men</p>
<p class="verse">Þat strange Inglis can not ken;</p>
<p class="verse">For many it ere þat strange Inglis</p>
<p class="verse">In ryme wate neuer what it is,</p>
<p class="verse">And bot þai wist what it mente,</p>
<p class="verse">Ellis me thoght it were alle schente.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Chronicle</i>, ll. 72 ff.)</p>

</div>

<p>The simple form reflects the writer's frankness and directness. He
points a moral fearlessly, but without harshness or self-righteousness.
And the range of his sympathies and interests makes <i>Handlyng Synne</i> the
best picture of English life before Langland and Chaucer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="II"></a>II</span>
<span>SIR ORFEO</span>
</h2>

<p><i>Sir Orfeo</i> is found in three MSS.: (1) the Auchinleck MS. (1325-1350),
a famous Middle English miscellany now in the Advocates' Library,
Edinburgh; (2) British Museum MS. Harley 3810 (fifteenth century); (3)
Bodleian MS. Ashmole 61 (fifteenth century). Our text follows the
Auchinleck MS., with ll. 1-24 and ll. 33-46 supplied from the Harleian
MS. The critical text of O. Zielke, Breslau 1880, reproduces the MSS.
inaccurately.</p>

<p>The story appears to have been translated from a French source into
South-Western English at the beginning of the fourteenth century. It
belongs to a group of 'lays' which claim to derive from Brittany, e.g.
<i>Lai le Freine</i>, which has the same opening lines (1-22); <i>Emaré</i>; and
Chaucer's <i>Franklin's Tale</i>.</p>

<p>The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was known to the Middle Ages chiefly
from Ovid (<i>Metamorphoses</i> x) and from Virgil (<i>Georgics</i> iv). King
Alfred's rendering of it in his <i>Boethius</i> is one of his best prose
passages, despite the crude moralizing which makes Orpheus's backward
glance at Eurydice before she is safe from Hades a symbol of the
backslider's longing for his old sins. The Middle English poet has a
lighter and daintier touch. The Greek myth is almost lost in a tale of
fairyland, the earliest English romance of the kind; and to provide the
appropriate happy ending, Sir Orfeo is made successful in his attempt to
rescue Heurodis. The adaptation of the classical subject to a mediaeval
setting is thorough. An amusing instance is the attempt in the
Auchinleck MS. to give the poem an English interest by the unconvincing
assurance that <i>Traciens</i> (which from 'Thracian' had come to mean
'Thrace') was the old name of Winchester (ll. 49-50).</p>

<span class="larger"><a id="III"></a>III</span>
<span>MICHAEL OF NORTHGATE'S AYENBYTE OF INWYT</span>
<span class="smaller"><small>A.D.</small> 1340. </span>
</h2>

<p>Michael of Northgate was a monk of St. Augustine's, Canterbury. From a
library catalogue of the monastery it appears that he was a lover of
books, for he is named as the donor of twenty-five MSS., a considerable
collection for those days. Their titles show a taste not merely for
religious works, but for science—mathematics, chemistry, medicine, as
they were known at the time. Four of these MSS. have been traced, and
one of them, British Museum MS. Arundel 57, is Michael's autograph copy
of the <i>Ayenbyte</i>. On folio 2 of the MS. are the words: <i>Þis boc is Dan
Michelis of Northgate, ywrite an Englis of his oȝene hand, þet hatte
'Ayenbyte of Inwyt'; and is of the boc-house of Saynt Austines of
Canterberi, mid þe lettres. CC.</i> 'CC.' is the press-mark given in the
catalogue. A note at the end of the text shows that it was finished on
October 27, 1340:</p>

<p><i>Ymende þet þis boc is uolueld ine þe eue of þe holy apostles Symon an
Iudas</i> [i.e. Oct. 27] <i>of ane broþer of the cloystre of Sauynt Austin of
Canterberi, in the yeare of oure Lhordes beringe 1340.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Ayenbyte</i> has been edited for the Early English Text Society by R.
Morris. The title means literally 'Remorse of Conscience', but from the
contents of the work it would appear that the writer meant rather
'Stimulus to the Conscience', or 'Prick of Conscience'. It is in fact a
translation from the French <i>Somme des Vices et des Vertues</i>, compiled
by Friar Lorens in 1279 for King Philip le Hardi, and long held to be
the main source of Chaucer's <i>Parson's Tale</i>. Caxton rendered the
<i>Somme</i> into English prose as <i>The Royal Book</i>. It treats of the
Commandments, the Creed, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Petitions of
the Paternoster, and the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Dan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_033">[033]</a></span> Michael's purpose is stated in some doggerel lines at the end:</p>


<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">Nou ich wille þet ye ywyte</p>
<p class="verse">Hou hit is ywent</p>
<p class="verse">Þet þis boc is ywrite</p>
<p class="verse">Mid Engliss of Kent.</p>
<p class="verse">Þis boc is ymad uor lewede men,</p>
<p class="verse">Vor uader, and uor moder, and uor oþer ken,</p>
<p class="verse">Ham uor to berȝe uram alle manyere zen,</p>
<p class="verse">Þet ine hare inwytte ne bleue no uoul wen.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">His translation is inaccurate, and sometimes unintelligible, and
the treatment is so barren of interest that the work seems to have
fallen flat even in its own day, when the popular appetite for
edification was keen and unspoiled. But if its literary merit is
slight, linguistically it is one of the most important works in
Middle English. It provides a long prose text, exactly dated and
exactly localized; we have the author's autograph copy to work
from; and the dialect is well distinguished. These circumstances,
unique in Middle English, make it possible to study the Kentish
dialect of the mid-fourteenth century under ideal conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="IV"></a>IV</span>
<span>RICHARD ROLLE OF HAMPOLE</span>
<span class="smaller">D. 1349.</span>
</h2>

<p>Richard Rolle was born at Thornton-le-Dale, near Pickering, in
Yorkshire. He was sent to Oxford, already a formidable rival to the
University of Paris; but the severer studies were evidently uncongenial
to his impulsive temperament. He returned home without taking orders,
improvised for himself a hermit's dress, and fled into solitude. His
piety attracted the favour of Sir John and Lady Dalton, who gave him a
cell on their estate. Here, in meditation, he developed his mystical
religion. He did not immure himself, or cut himself off from human
companionship. For a time he lived near Anderby, where was the cell of
the recluse Margaret Kirkby, to whom he addressed his <i>Form of Perfect
Living</i>. Another important work, <i>Ego Dormio et Cor Meum Vigilat</i>, was
written for a nun of Yedingham (Yorks.). Towards the end of his life he
lived in close friendship with the nuns of Hampole, and for one of them
he wrote his <i>Commandment of Love to God</i>. At Hampole he died in 1349,
the year of the Black Death. By the devout he was regarded as a saint,
and had his commemoration day, his office, and his miracles; but he was
never canonized.</p>

<p>He wrote both in Latin and in English, and it is not always easy to
distinguish his work from that of his many followers and imitators. The
writings attributed to him are edited by C. Horstmann, <i>Yorkshire
Writers</i>, 2 vols., London 1895-6. Besides the prose works noted above,
he wrote, at the request of Margaret Kirkby, a <i>Commentary on the
Psalms</i> (ed. Bramley, Oxford 1884), based on the Latin of Peter Lombard.
A long didactic poem in Northern English, the <i>Prick of Conscience</i>, has
been attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_037">[037]</a></span> him from Lydgate's time onwards; but his authorship
has recently been questioned, chiefly on the ground that the poem is
without a spark of inspiration. It is not certain that he wrote <i>Love is
Life</i>, which is included here because it expresses in characteristic
language his central belief in the personal bond, the burning love,
between God and man. The first prose selection shows that he did not
disdain the examples from natural history that were so popular in the
sermons of the time. The second is chapter xi of the <i>Form of Perfect
Living</i>, which is found as a separate extract from an early date.</p>

<p>With Rolle began a movement of devotional piety, which, as might be
expected from its strong appeal to the emotions, was taken up first
among religious women; and signs of a striving for effect in his style
suggest that the hermit was not indifferent to the admiration of his
followers. He brings to his teaching more heart than mind. He escapes
the problems of the world, which seemed so insistent to his
contemporaries, by denying the world's claims. His ideas and temperament
are diametrically opposed to those of the other great figure in the
religious life of fourteenth-century England—Wiclif, the schoolman,
politician, reformer, controversialist. Yet they have in common a
sincerity and directness of belief that brushes aside conventions, and
an enthusiasm that made them leaders in an age when the Church as a
whole suffered from apathy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="V"></a>V</span>
<span>SIR GAWAYNE AND THE GRENE KNIGHT</span>
<span class="smaller">ABOUT 1350-75.</span>
</h2>


<p><i>Sir Gawayne</i> has been admirably edited by Sir F. Madden for the
Bannatyne Club, 1839, and later by R. Morris for the Early English Text
Society. It is found in British Museum MS. Nero A X, together with three
other alliterative poems, named from their first words <i>Pearl</i>,
<i>Patience</i>, and <i>Cleanness</i>. <i>Pearl</i> supplies the next specimen;
<i>Patience</i> exemplifies the virtue by the trials of Jonah; <i>Cleanness</i>
teaches purity of life from Scriptural stories. All these poems are in
the same handwriting; all are in a West-Midland dialect; all appear to
be of the same age; and none is without literary merit. For these
reasons, which are good but not conclusive, they are assumed to be by
the same author. Attempts to identify this author have been
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The story runs as follows:</p>

<p>King Arthur is making his Christmas feast with his court at Camelot. On
New Year's Day he declares that he will not eat until he has seen or
heard some marvel. The first course of the feast is barely served when a
tall knight, clad all in green, with green hair, and a green horse to
match, rides into the hall. He carries a holly bough and a huge axe, and
tauntingly invites any knight to strike him a blow with the axe, on
condition that he will stand a return blow on the same day a year hence.
Gawayne accepts the challenge and strikes off the Green Knight's head.
The Green Knight gathers up his head, gives Gawayne an appointment for
next New Year's Day at the Green Chapel, and rides off.</p>

<p>The year passes, and Gawayne, despite the fears of the court, sets out
in quest of the Green Chapel. On Christmas Eve he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_045">[045]</a></span>
arrives at a splendid
castle, and finding that the Green Chapel is close at hand, accepts an
invitation to stay and rest until New Year's Day. On each of three days
the knight of the castle goes hunting, and persuades Gawayne to rest at
home. They make an agreement that each shall give the other whatever he
gets. The lady of the castle makes love to Gawayne, and kisses him once
on the first day, twice on the second day, thrice on the third day; and
on the third day she gives him her girdle, which he accepts because it
has the magic power of preserving the wearer from wounds. Each evening
he duly gives the kisses to the knight, and receives in return the
spoils of the hunting of deer and boar and fox. But he conceals the
girdle.</p>

<p>The extract begins with Gawayne preparing on New Year's morning to stand
the return blow at the Green Chapel.</p>

<p>The poem ends by the Green Knight revealing that he is himself the lord
of the castle; that he went to Arthur's court at the suggestion of
Morgan la Fay; that he had urged his wife to make love to Gawayne and
try his virtue; and that he would not have harmed him at all, if he had
not committed the slight fault of concealing the girdle. Gawayne returns
to the court, bearing the girdle as a sign of his shame, and tells his
story. The knights of the court agree in future to wear a bright green
belt for Gawayne's sake.</p>

<p><i>Sir Gawayne</i> is admittedly the best of the alliterative romances. It
must have come down to us practically as it was written by the poet, for
it is free from the flatness and conventional phrasing which is
characteristic of romances that have passed through many popular
recensions. The descriptions of nature, of armour and dresses, the
hunting scenes, and the love making, are all excellently done; and the
poet shows the same richness of imagination and skill in producing
pictorial effects that are so noticeable in <i>Pearl</i>. He has too a quiet
humour that recalls Chaucer in some of his moods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="VI"></a>VI</span>
<span>THE PEARL</span>
<span class="smaller">A<small>BOUT</small> 1375.</span>
</h2>



<p>The facts leading to the presumption that <i>Pearl</i> and <i>Sir Gawayne</i> are
by the same author have been mentioned in the prefatory note to <i>Sir
Gawayne</i>. But the poems are markedly different in subject and tone.
<i>Pearl</i>, like Chaucer's <i>Death of Blanche the Duchess</i>, is an elegy cast
in the vision form made popular by the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>. The subject
is a little girl, who died before she was two years old, and the
treatment is deeply religious. Her death is symbolized as the loss of a
pearl without spot, that slipped from its owner's hand through the grass
into the earth.</p>

<p>On a festival day in August, the poet, while mourning his loss, falls
asleep on his child's grave. His spirit passes to a land of flowers and
rich fruits, where birds of flaming hues sing incomparably, where the
cliffs are of crystal and beryl, and a river runs in a bed of gleaming
jewels. On the other side of the river, which is lovelier still, sits a
maiden dressed all in white, with coronet and ornaments of pearl. The
poet recognizes his lost child, but cannot call to her for wonder and
dread, until she rises and salutes him. He complains that since her loss
he has been a joyless jeweller. She rebukes him gently; she is not lost,
but made safe and beautiful for ever. Overjoyed, he says he will cross
the river and live with her in this paradise; but she warns him against
such presumption, for since Adam's fall the river may be crossed only by
the way of death. He is in despair to think that now that his Pearl is
found, he must still live joyless, apart from her; but he is bidden to
resign himself to God's will and mercy, because rebellion will avail him
nothing.</p>

<p>At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_058">[058]</a></span> this point begins the argument on salvation by grace or salvation by
works which is here reprinted.</p>

<p>The maiden then continues the discussion, explaining that 'the innocent
are ay safe by right', and that only those who come as little children
can win the bliss sought by the man who sold his all for a matchless
pearl.</p>

<p>Next the poet asks whence her beauty comes, and what her office is. She
replies that she is one of the brides of Christ, whom St. John in the
Apocalypse saw arrayed for the bridal in the New Jerusalem. He asks to
see their mansions, and by special grace is allowed to view the holy
city from without. He sees it as St. John saw it, gleaming with gold,
with its pillars of precious stone, its gates of pearl; its streets
lighted by a divine radiance, so that there is no need of moon or sun.
There is no church or chapel or temple there: God himself is the
minister, and Christ is the sacrifice. Mortal eye could not bear the
splendour, and he stood 'as stylle as dased quayle'. At evening came the
procession of the virgin brides of Christ, each bearing on her breast
the pearl of perfect happiness. The Lamb leads them, in pearl-white
robes, his side bleeding, his face rapt; while elders make obeisance,
and angels sing songs of joy as He nears the throne of God.</p>

<p>Suddenly the poet sees his Pearl among her companions. Overcome with
longing and delight, he tries to cross the river, only to wake in the
garden where he fell asleep. Henceforth he is resigned to the pleasure
of the Prince of Heaven.</p>

<p>The reader will be able to judge the author's poetical gift from the
selection, which has been chosen as one of the less ornate passages.
Even here the form distracts attention from the matter by its
elaborateness. A difficult rime scheme is superimposed on the
alliterative line; stanza is interlinked with stanza; each group of five
stanzas is distinguished by a similar refrain, and bound to the
preceding and following groups by repetition in the first and last
lines. So too the close of the poem echoes the beginning. With such
intricacy of plan, it is not surprising that the rime is sometimes
forced, and the sense strained or obscure. It is rather a matter for
wonder that, in so long a work, the author was able to maintain his
marvellous technique without completely sacrificing poetry to metrical
gymnastics.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_059">[059]</a></span> highly wrought, almost overwrought, effect is heightened when the
poem is read as a whole. If <i>Piers Plowman</i> gives a realistic picture of
the drabness of mediaeval life, <i>Pearl</i>, more especially in the early
stanzas, shows a richness of imagery and a luxuriance in light and
colour that seem scarcely English. Yet they have their parallels in the
decorative art of the time—the elaborate carving in wood and stone; the
rich colouring of tapestries, of illuminated books and painted glass;
the designs of the jewellers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths, which even
the notaries who made the old inventories cannot pass without a word of
admiration. The <i>Pearl</i> reminds us of the tribute due to the artists and
craftsmen of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The edition by C. G. Osgood, Boston 1906, is the handiest.</p>

<span>THE GEST HYSTORIALE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF TROY</span>
<span class="smaller">A<small>BOUT</small> 1375.</span>
</h2>

<p>The Fall of Troy was one of the most popular subjects of mediaeval
story. Lydgate wrote a <i>Troy Book</i> about 1420; fragments of another are
attributed to 'Barbour', whose identity with the author of <i>The Bruce</i>
has been questioned; a third version, anonymous, is known as the <i>Laud
Troy Book</i>; and Caxton chose as the first work to be printed in English
the <i>Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</i> (about 1474). More famous than
any of these full histories are two single stories detached from the
cycle: Jason's Quest of the Golden Fleece, which is admirably told by
Gower in the fifth book of his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>; and the Love of
Troilus and Cressida, which gave a theme both to Chaucer and to
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The <i>Gest Hystoriale of the Destruction of Troy</i>, from which our
extracts are taken, is a free rendering of the prose <i>Historia Troiana</i>
finished in 1287 by Guido de Columna (most probably the modern Terranova
in Sicily). The translation, which appears to have been made in the
North or North-West Midlands in the second half of the fourteenth
century, is preserved only in an imperfect fifteenth-century MS. at the
Hunterian Museum, Glasgow. In the Early English Text Society's print,
edited by Panton and Donaldson, the text extends to over 14,000 lines.</p>

<p>The table of contents prefixed to the MS. promises '<i>the nome of the
knight þat causet it</i> [sc. <i>the story</i>] <i>to be made, and the nome of hym
that translatid it out of Latyn into Englysshe</i>'; but the extant MS.
does not fulfil the promise. The execution suggests a set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_069">[069]</a></span> task and a
journeyman poet. Phrases are repeated carelessly; there is a great deal
of padding; the versification is monotonous; and the writer is too often
at the mercy of the alliteration to maintain a serious level. Yet he is
not a slavish or a dull translator. The more romantic elements of the
story, such as the matter of the <i>Odyssey</i>, had already been whittled
away in his original, and he shows little desire or capacity to restore
them. But he knew as well as the Old English poets the forcefulness of
alliterative verse in scenes of violence, and describes with unflagging
zest and vigour the interminable battles of the siege, and storms such
as that which wrecked the fleet of Ajax.</p>

<p>The Prologue is a curious example of the pseudo-critical attitude of the
Middle Ages. Homer is despised as a teller of impossible tales, and a
partisan of the Greeks,—for Hector is the popular hero of the mediaeval
versions. The narratives of Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis,
products of the taste for fictitious history that spread westward from
Greek-speaking lands in the fourth and following centuries, are accepted
as reliable documents; and Guido de Columna as their authoritative
literary interpreter. No mention is made of Benoît de Sainte-Maure,
whose <i>Roman de Troie</i>, written in French about 1184, served as source
to Guido, and, directly or indirectly, as inspiration to the whole body
of Western writers who dealt with the 'Matter of Troy'. For these lapses
the English translator need not be held responsible. On the merits of
Homer, Dares, Dictys, and Guido de Columna, he probably accepted without
question the word of his master Guido.</p>

<span class="larger"><a id="VIII"></a>VIII</span>
<span>PIERS PLOWMAN</span>
<span class="smaller">(1362-1400)</span>
<span class="smaller">B<small>Y</small> WILLIAM LANGLAND</span>
</h2>

<p>Recent criticism of <i>Piers Plowman</i> has done more to weaken the hold of
opinions once generally accepted than to replace them by others better
founded. It is still most probable that 'Long Will', who is more than
once mentioned in the text as the poet, was William Langland. The
earliest external evidence of his home and parentage is given in a
fifteenth-century note in MS. Dublin D 4. 1, of which both the matter
and the vile Latinity bear the stamp of genuineness: 'Memorandum quod
Stacy de Rokayle, pater Willielmi de Langlond, qui Stacius fuit
generosus, et morabatur in Schiptone under Whicwode, tenens domini le
Spenser in comitatu Oxon., qui praedictus Willielmus fecit librum qui
vocatur Perys Ploughman.' Shipton-under-Wychwood is near Burford in
Oxfordshire. The poem shows familiarity with the Malvern Hills and the
streets of London; but it is hard to say how much is fact and how much
is fiction in the references to Long Will in the text itself, more
especially the description of his London life added as the Sixth Passus
in Version C, and reproduced here as the second extract.</p>

<p>Since Skeat's edition for the Early English Text Society, the many
manuscripts have been grouped into three main types. The shortest, or
A-text, appears from internal evidence to have been written about 1362.
The B-text (about 1377) has the most compact manuscript tradition. It is
distinguished by considerable additions throughout, and by the
reconstruction and expansion of the visions of Dowel, Dobet, Dobest,
which make up the second half of the poem. The C-text, the latest and
fullest form, appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_077">[077]</a></span> to have been completed in the last decade of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Until recently it has been assumed that these three versions represent
progressive revisions by the author. But Professor Manly has found
considerable support for his view that more than one writer—perhaps as
many as five—had a share in the work. For the present, judgement on
this question, and on the intricate problem of the relations of the
different versions, is suspended until the results of a complete
re-examination of all the MSS. are available. It would not be surprising
to find that even when this necessary work is done differences of
opinion on the larger questions remain as acute as ever.</p>

<p>It is impossible in short space to give an outline of the whole work,
which describes no less than eleven visions. The structure is loose, and
allegory is developed or dropped with disconcerting abruptness, for the
writer does not curb his vigorous imagination in the interests of formal
correctness.</p>

<p>The first part is the best known. On a May morning the poet falls asleep
on the Malvern Hills and sees a 'Field full of Folk', where all classes
of men are busy about their occupations, more particularly the nefarious
occupations that engage the attention of the moralist. Holy Church
explains that a high tower in the Field is the home of Truth; and that a
'deep dale' is the Castle of Care, where Wrong dwells with the wicked.
She points out Falseness, who is about to marry Lady Meed (i.e. Reward,
whether deserved reward or bribe). Lady Meed and her company are haled
before the King, who, with Reason and Conscience as his guides, decides
her case, and upholds the plea of Peace against Wrong.</p>

<p>The second vision is prefaced (in the C-text only) by the passage
printed as the second selection. The poet falls asleep again, and sees
Conscience preaching to the people in the Field. Representatives of the
Seven Deadly Sins are vividly described. They are brought to penitence,
and all set out in search of Truth. But no one knows the way. A palmer
who wears the trophies of many pilgrimages to distant saints is puzzled
by their inquiries, for he has never heard of pilgrims seeking Truth.
Then Peter the Plowman comes forward and explains the way in
allegorical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_078">[078]</a></span> terms. Here the first extract begins. The second vision
closes with a general pardon given by Truth to Piers Plowman in this
simple form:</p>


<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">Do wel, and haue wel, and God shal haue þi sowle;</p>
<p class="verse">And do yuel, and haue yuel, hope þow non other</p>
<p class="verse">But after þi ded-day þe Deuel shal haue þi sowle.</p>

</div>

<p>The several visions of the second part make up the lives of
Dowel, Dobet, and Dobest. Piers Plowman is there identified
with Christ, and the poem ends with Conscience, almost overcome
by sin, setting out resolutely in search of Piers.</p>

<p>First impressions of mediaeval life are usually coloured by the
courtly romances of Malory and his later refiners. Chaucer
brings us down to reality, but his people belong to a prosperous
middle-class world, on holiday and in holiday mood. <i>Piers Plowman</i>
stands alone as a revelation of the ignorance and misery of
the lower classes, whose multiplied grievances came to a head in
the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It must not be supposed that
Langland idealized the labourers. Their indolence and improvidence
are exposed as unsparingly as the vices of the rich; and
Piers himself is not so much a representative of the English workman
in the fourteenth century as a character drawn straight
from the Gospels. Still, such an eager plea for humbleness, simplicity,
and honest labour, could not fail to encourage the political
hopes of the poor, and we see in John Ball's letter (p. 160) that
'Piers Plowman' had become a catchword among them. The
poet himself rather deprecates political action. His satire is
directed against the general slackening of the bonds of duty that
marked the last years of an outworn system of society. For the
remedy of abuses he appeals not to one class but to all: king,
nobles, clergy, and workers must model their lives on the pattern
of the Gospels.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="IX"></a>IX</span>
<span>MANDEVILLE'S TRAVELS</span>
</h2>


<p><i>Mandeville's Travels</i> were originally written in French, perhaps in
1356 or 1357. Their popularity was immediate, and Latin and English
translations soon appeared. The English texts published show three
forms. The first, imperfect, is the text of the early prints. The
second, from Cotton MS. Titus C xvi (about 1400-25), was first printed
in 1725, and is followed in the editions by Halliwell, 1839 and 1866,
and by Hamelius, 1919. The third, from Egerton MS. 1982 (about 1400-25),
has been edited for the Roxburghe Club by G. F. Warner, with the French
text, and an excellent apparatus. Our selections follow the Cotton MS.</p>

<p>The <i>Travels</i> fall into two parts: (i) a description of the routes to
the Holy Land, and an account of the Holy Places; (ii) a narrative of
travel in the more distant parts of Asia. Throughout the author poses as
an eyewitness. But in fact the book is a compilation, made without much
regard to time or place. For the first part William de Boldensele, who
wrote in 1336 an account of a visit to the Holy Land, is the main
source. The second part follows the description of an Eastern voyage
written by Friar Odoric of Pordenone in 1330. Other materials from the
mediaeval encyclopaedists are woven in, and there is so little trace of
original observation that it is doubtful whether the author travelled
far beyond his library.</p>

<p>In the preface he claims to be Sir John Mandeville, an Englishman born
at St. Albans. The people of St. Albans were driven to desperate shifts
to explain the absence of his tomb from their abbey; but until 1798 it
was actually to be seen at the church of the Guillemins, Liège, with
this inscription:</p>

<p>'Hic iacet vir nobilis Dom Ioannes de Mandeville, alias dictus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_095">[095]</a></span> ad
Barbam, Miles, Dominus de Campdi, natus de Anglia, medicinae professor,
devotissimus orator, et bonorum suorum largissimus pauperibus erogator,
qui, toto quasi orbe lustrato, Leodii diem vitae suae clausit extremum
<small>A.D.</small> MCCCLXXII, mensis Nov. die xvii.'</p>

<p>A Liège chronicler, Jean d'Outremeuse (d. 1399), who claims the
invidious position of his confidant and literary executor, gives further
details: Mandeville was 'chevalier de Montfort en Angleterre'; he was
obliged to leave England because he had slain a nobleman; he came to
Liège in 1343; and was content to be known as 'Jean de Bourgogne dit à
la Barbe'.</p>

<p>Now Jean de Bourgogne, with whom Sir John Mandeville is identified by
d'Outremeuse, is known as the writer of a tract on the Plague, written
at Liège in 1365. Further, the Latin text of the <i>Travels</i> mentions that
the author met at Liège a certain 'Johannes ad Barbam', recognized him
as a former physician at the court of the Sultan of Egypt, and took his
advice and help in the writing of the <i>Travels</i>.</p>

<p>Again, in 1322, the year in which Sir John Mandeville claims to have
left England, a Johan de Burgoyne was given good reason to flee the
country, because a pardon, granted to him the previous year for his
actions against the Despensers, was then withdrawn. Curiously enough, a
John Mandeville was also of the party opposed to the Despensers.</p>

<p>Nothing has come of the attempts to attach the clues—St. Albans,
Montfort, Campdi, the arms on the tomb at Liège—to the English family
of Mandeville. It seems likely that 'Sir John Mandeville' was an alias
adopted by Jean de Bourgogne, unless both names cover Jean d'Outremeuse.
The Epilogue to the Cotton version shows how early the plausible
fictions of the text had infected the history of its composition.</p>

<p>It is clear that the English versions do not come from the hand of the
writer of the <i>Travels</i>, who could not have been guilty of such
absurdities as the translation of <i>montaignes</i> by 'þe hille of Aygnes'
in the Cotton MS. But whoever the author was, he shows a courtesy and
modesty worthy of a knight, begging those with more recent experience to
correct the lapses of his memory, and remembering always the interests
of later travellers, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_096">[096]</a></span> might wish to glean some marvels still untold.
He might well have pleaded in the fourteenth century that the time had
not come when prose fiction could afford to throw off the disguise of
truth.</p>

<p class="numbered">Now schall I seye ȝou sewyngly of contrees and yles þat ben

{135}</span> I seye
ȝou, in passynge be the lond of Cathaye toward the high Ynde, and

{160}</span>  þat same regioun ben the mountaynes of
Caspye þat men clepen 'Vber' in the contree. Betwene þo mountaynes the
Iewes of ten lynages ben enclosed, þat men clepen Goth and Magoth; and
þei mowe not gon out on no syde. Þere weren enclosed twenty two kynges
with hire peple, þat dwelleden  <span class="linenum" title="165"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">

Þere Kyng Alisandre chacede hem betwene þo mountaynes; and þere he

þat he myghte not don it, ne bryng it to an ende, he preyed to God of
Nature þat He wolde parforme þat þat he
<span class="linenum" title="170"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">
{170}</span>  had begonne. And all were
it so þat he was a payneme, and not worthi to ben herd, ȝit God of
His grace closed the mountaynes togydre; so þat þei dwellen þere, all

on o syde; and on þat syde is the See of Caspye. Now
<span class="linenum" title="175"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">
{175}</span>  may sum men
asken: sith þat the see is on þat o syde, wherfore go þei not out on the

answere: þat See of Caspye goth out be londe, vnder the mountaynes, and
renneth be the desert at o syde of the contree; and after it streccheth
vnto the endes <span class="linenum" title="180"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">
{180}</span>  of Persie. And allþough it be clept a see, it is no
see, ne it toucheth to non oþer see; but it is a lake, the grettest of
the world. And þough þei wolden putten hem into þat see, þei ne wysten
neuer where þat þei scholde arryuen. And also þei conen no langage but
only hire owne, þat no man
<span class="linenum" title="185"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">

not gon out. And also ȝee schull vnderstonde þat the Iewes han no
propre lond of hire owne, for to dwellen inne, in all the world, but
only þat lond betwene the mountaynes. And ȝit þei ȝelden tribute
for þat lond to the queen of Amazoine, the whiche þat
<span class="linenum" title="190"><!-- --></span><span class="lbrace">

to ben kept in cloos full diligently, þat þei schull not gon out on

ne

clepen in þat contree 'Clyron'. And þat

exchequer, and a royal pensioner. Consequently a number of isolated
records of his activities have been preserved. In 1364 he was granted a
safe-conduct to travel with four students to Oxford. In 1365 and 1368 he
had permission to travel through England so that he might study in
France. The notices of his journeys, his offices, and his rewards point
to a busy and successful life. He died in 1395.</p>

<p>According to Wyntoun, Barbour's works were (1) <i>The Bruce</i>; (2) <i>The
Stewartis Oryginalle</i> (or <i>Pedigree of the Stewarts</i>), now lost; (3) a
<i>Brut</i>, which some have identified with extant fragments of a Troy Book
(see the prefatory note to No. VII), and others with (2) <i>The Stewartis
Oryginalle</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Bruce</i> is found in two late MSS., both copied by John Ramsay; the
first, St. John's College, Cambridge, MS. G 23, in the year 1487; the
second, now at the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, in 1489. It has been
edited by Skeat for the Early English Text Society, and for the Scottish
Text Society. The poem is valuable for the history, more especially the
traditional history, of the period 1304-33. Barbour speaks of it as a
romance, and the freedom and vividness of the narrative, with its
hero-worship of Robert Bruce and Douglas, place it well above the
ordinary chronicle. But far from disclaiming historical accuracy,
Barbour prides himself that truth well told should have a double claim
to popularity:</p>

<p>He did not misjudge the taste of his country, and <i>The Bruce</i>,
with which the Scottish contribution to English literature begins,
long held its place as the national epic of Scotland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XI"></a>XI</span>
<span>JOHN WICLIF</span>
<span class="smaller"><small>D.</small> 1384.</span>
</h2>



<p>Like Richard Rolle, Wiclif was a Yorkshireman by birth. Of his career at
Oxford little is known until 1360, when he is described as 'master of
Balliol'. From Balliol he was presented to the living of Fillingham,
and, after a series of preferments, he accepted in 1374 the rectory of
Lutterworth, which he held till his death in 1384.</p>

<p>Wiclif's life was stormy. His acknowledged pre-eminence as a theologian
and doctor in the University did not satisfy his active and combative
mind. 'False peace', he said, 'is grounded in rest with our enemies,
when we assent to them without withstanding; and sword against such
peace came Christ to send.' He lacked neither enemies nor the moral
courage to withstand them.</p>

<p>At first, under the powerful patronage of John of Gaunt, he entered into
controversies primarily political, opposing the right of the Pope to
make levies on England, which was already overburdened with
war-taxation, and to appoint foreigners to English benefices. On these
questions popular opinion was on his side.</p>

<p>He proceeded to attack the whole system of Church government, urging
disendowment; rejecting the papal authority, which had been weakened in
1378 by the fierce rivalry of Urban VI and Clement VII; attacking
episcopal privileges, the established religious orders, and the abuse of
indulgences, pardons, and sanctuary. Still his opinions found a good
deal of popular and political support.</p>

<p>Then in 1380 he publicly announced his rejection of the doctrine of
transubstantiation. From the results of such a heresy his friends could
no longer protect him. Moderate opinion became alarmed and conservative
after the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Richard II was no friend of
heretics. John of Gaunt, himself unpopular by this time, commanded
silence. And in 1382
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> the secular party in Oxford were compelled, after
a struggle, to condemn and expel their favourite preacher and his
followers. Wiclif retired to Lutterworth, and continued, until struck
down by paralysis in the last days of 1384, to inspire his 'poor
preachers'—the founders of the Lollard sect which lived on to join
forces with Lutheranism in the sixteenth century—and to develop in a
series of Latin and English works the doctrines that later came to be
associated with Puritanism.</p>

<p>His authorship is often doubtful. In the interests of orthodoxy the
early MSS. of his writings were ruthlessly destroyed, as in the famous
bonfire of his works at Carfax, Oxford, in 1411. And his followers
included not only the simple folk from whom later the 'poor priests'
were recruited, but able University men, trained in his new doctrines,
bred in the same traditions, and eager to emulate their master in
controversy. So his share in the famous Wiclif Bible (ed. Forshall and
Madden, Oxford 1850) is still uncertain. Part of the translation seems
to have been made by Nicholas of Hereford, and a later recension is
claimed for another Oxford disciple, John Purvey. But Wiclif probably
inspired the undertaking, for to him, as to the later Puritans, the word
of the Bible was the test by which all matters of belief, ritual, and
Church government must be tried; and he was particularly anxious, in
opposition to the established clergy and the friars, that laymen should
read it in their own language. Contemporaries, friend and foe, ascribe
the actual translation to him. John Huss, the Bohemian reformer, who was
martyred in 1416 for teaching Wiclif's doctrines, states that Wiclif
'translated all the Bible into English'. Arundel, Archbishop of
Canterbury, is equally positive when he writes to the Pope in 1412 that
'the son of the Old Serpent filled up the cup of his malice against Holy
Church by the device of a new translation of the Scriptures into his
native tongue'.</p>

<p>The first selection, chapter xv of the <i>De Officio Pastorali</i> (ed.
Matthew, pp. 429 f.), states the case for translation. In the second
(ed. Matthew, pp. 188 ff.) some essential points of Wiclif's teaching
are explained.</p>

<p>In abuse of his opponents he maintains the sturdy tradition of
controversy that still survives in Milton's prose. The style
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>  is rugged
and vigorous; the thought logical and packed close. And it is easy to
see the source of his strength. In an age whose evils were patent to
all, many reproved this or that particular abuse, but the system as a
whole passed unchallenged. Wiclif, almost alone in his generation, had
the reasoning power to go to the root of the matter, and the moral
courage not only to state fearlessly what, rightly or wrongly, he found
to be the source of evil, but to insist on basic reform. It is difficult
nowadays, when modern curiosity has made familiar the practice of mining
among the foundations of beliefs, society, and government, to realize
the force of authority that was ranged against unorthodox reformers in
the fourteenth century. If the popular support he received indicates
that this force was already weakening, Wiclif must still be reckoned
among the greatest of those who broke the way for the modern world.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XII"></a>XII</span>
<span>JOHN GOWER</span>
<span class="smaller"><small>D.</small> 1408.</span>
</h2>



<p>John Gower, a Londoner himself, came of a good Kentish family. Chaucer
must have known him well, for he chose him as his attorney when leaving
for the Continent in 1378, and, with the dedication of <i>Troilus and
Criseyde</i>, labelled him for ever as 'moral Gower'. Gower's marriage with
Agnes Groundolf, probably a second marriage, is recorded in 1398.
Blindness came on him a few years later. His will, dated August 15,
1408, was proved on October 24, 1408, so that his death must fall
between those two points. By his own wish he was buried in St.
Saviour's, Southwark, the church of the canons of St. Mary Overy, to
whom he was a liberal benefactor.</p>

<p>On his tomb in St. Saviour's Church, Gower is shown with his head
resting on three great volumes, representing his principal works—the
<i>Speculum Meditantis</i>, the <i>Vox Clamantis</i>, and the <i>Confessio Amantis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Speculum Meditantis</i>, or <i>Mirour de l'Omme</i>, is a handbook of sins
and sinners, written in French.</p>

<p>The <i>Vox Clamantis</i>, written in Latin, covers similar ground. Opening
with a vision of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the poet passes in review
the faults of the different grades of society—clergy, nobles,
labourers, traders, lawyers—and ends with an admonition to the young
King Richard II.</p>

<p>In his English work, the <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, he expressly abandons the
task of setting the world to rights, and promises to change his style
henceforth. Now he will sing of Love. The machinery of the poem is
suggested by the great source of mediaeval conventions, the <i>Roman de la
Rose</i>. On a May morning the poet, a victim of love, wanders afield and
meets the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> Queen of Love (cp. the beginning of Chaucer's <i>Legend of Good
Women</i>). She bids him confess to her priest Genius. Genius hears the
confession, sustaining with some incongruity the triple rôle of high
priest of Love, Christian moralist, and entertainer—for it is he who
tells the stories which, woven about the frame work of the Seven Deadly
Sins, make the real matter of the poem.</p>

<p>The first form of the <i>Confessio</i> was completed in 1390. It contains a
Prologue in which the suggestion for the poem is ascribed to Richard II,
and an Epilogue in his praise. In this version the Queen of Love at
parting gives Gower a message for Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse indent2">And gret wel Chaucer whan ye mete,</p>
<p class="verse">As mi disciple and mi poete:</p>
<p class="verse">For in the floures of his youthe</p>
<p class="verse">In sondri wise, as he wel couthe,</p>
<p class="verse">Of ditees and of songes glade,</p>
<p class="verse">The whiche he for mi sake made,</p>
<p class="verse">The lond fulfild is overal.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherof to him in special</p>
<p class="verse">Above alle othre I am most holde.</p>
<p class="verse">Forthi now, in hise daies olde,</p>
<p class="verse">Thow schalt him telle this message,</p>
<p class="verse">That he upon his latere age,</p>
<p class="verse">To sette an ende of alle his werk,</p>
<p class="verse">As he which is myn owne clerk,</p>
<p class="verse">Do make his testament of love,</p>
<p class="verse">As thou hast do thi schrifte above,</p>
<p class="verse">So that mi Court it mai recorde.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the final form, completed in 1392-3, Richard's name disappears from
the Prologue; the dedication to his popular rival, Henry of Lancaster,
is made prominent; the eulogy in the Epilogue is dropped; and with it
the compliment to Chaucer. Whether this last omission is due to chance,
or to some change in the relations between the two poets, is not clear.</p>

<p>In his own day Gower was ranked with Chaucer. His reputation was still
high among the Elizabethans; and he has the distinction of appearing as
Chorus in a Shakespearian play—<i>Pericles</i>—of which his story of
<i>Apollonius of Tyre</i>, in Bk. viii of the <i>Confessio</i>, was the immediate
source.</p>

<p>A selection gives a very favourable impression of his work. He has a
perfect command of the octosyllabic couplet; an easy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> style, well suited
to narrative; and a classic simplicity of expression for which the work
of his predecessors in Middle English leaves us unprepared. Throughout
the whole of the <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, more than 30,000 lines, the level
of workmanship is remarkable, and almost every page shows some graceful
and poetical verses.</p>

<p>Yet the poem as a whole suffers from the fault that Gower tried to
avoid:</p>


<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">It dulleth ofte a mannes wit</p>
<p class="verse">To him that schal it aldai rede.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">One defect, obvious to a modern reader, would hardly be noticed by his
contemporaries: he often incorporates in his poetry matter proper only
to an encyclopaedia, such as the discourse on the religions of the world
in Bk. v, or that on Philosophy in Bk. vii. Another is more radical: for
all his wide reading, his leading ideas lack originality. It is hardly a
travesty to say that the teaching of his works amounts to this: 'In the
moral world, avoid the Seven Deadly Sins in the five sub-classifications
of each; in the political world keep your degree without presuming'.
Such a negative and conventional message cannot sustain the fabric of
three long poems. Their polished and facile moralizing becomes almost
exasperating if it be remembered that the poet wrote when a whole system
of society was falling, and falling noisily, about him. Modern taste
rejects Gower the moralist and political writer, and his claim to
present as apart from historical value rests on the delightful single
stories which served as embroidery to his serious themes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XIII"></a>XIII</span>
<span>JOHN OF TREVISA'S TRANSLATION OF HIGDEN'S POLYCHRONICON</span>
<span class="smaller">1387.</span>
</h2>

<p>Ranulph Higden (d. 1364) was a monk of St. Werburgh's at Chester, and
has been doubtfully identified with the 'Randal Higden' who is said to
have travelled to Rome to get the Pope's consent to the acting of the
Chester miracle plays in English.</p>

<p>His <i>Polychronicon</i>, so called because it is the chronicle of many ages,
is a compilation covering the period from the Creation to 1352. In the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it was the favourite universal
history; and the First Book, which deals with general geography, has
still a special interest for the light it throws on the state of
knowledge in Chaucer's day.</p>

<p>Two English prose translations are known: Trevisa's, completed in 1387,
and modernized and printed by Caxton in 1482; and an anonymous rendering
made in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. Both are printed,
with Higden's Latin, in the edition by Babington and Lumby, Rolls
Series, 9 vols., 1865-86.</p>

<p>John of Trevisa was a Cornishman. He was a fellow of Exeter College,
Oxford, from 1362 to 1365; and was one of those expelled from Queen's
College for 'unworthiness' in 1379. He became vicar of Berkeley, and at
the request of Sir Thomas Berkeley undertook the translation of the
<i>Polychronicon</i>. In 1398 he brought to an end another long work, the
translation of <i>Bartholomaeus de Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, the great
encyclopaedia of natural science at this time. He died at Berkeley in
1402.</p>

<p>Trevisa was a diligent but not an accurate or graceful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> translator. He
rarely adds anything from his own knowledge, though we have an example
in the account of the reform of teaching at Oxford while he was there.
The interest of his work depends chiefly on the curiosity of some
passages in his originals.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XIV"></a>XIV</span>
<span>POLITICAL PIECES</span>
</h2>


<p>In the thirteenth century political poems were written chiefly in Latin
or French. In the fourteenth century a steadily growing tendency to use
English witnesses the increased interest of the people in politics and
social questions. The fullest collections are those edited by T. Wright,
<i>Political Songs of England</i> (John to Edward II), Camden Society, 1839;
and <i>Political Poems and Songs</i> (Edward III to Richard III), Rolls
Series, 2 vols., 1859-61.</p>

<p>The selections A and B are from the poems of Laurence Minot, of which
the best edition is the third by J. Hall, Oxford 1914. Minot was a
better patriot than a poet, and his boisterous contempt for the Scots
and French reflects the spirit of England in the early days of Edward
III's greatness.</p>

<p>The empty phrases in which the anonymous piece C abounds do not disguise
a note of despair. The long war with France was becoming more and more
hopeless. The plague that added to its miseries had carried off Henry,
first Duke of Lancaster, in 1361. The Black Prince, to whom the nation
looked for guidance, had died in 1376. The inglorious old age of Edward
III ended in the following year. But there remained the hope, soon to be
falsified, that the boy king Richard II would steer the ship of state to
safety.</p>

<p>D is the earliest text of the letter which John Ball addressed to the
Essex members of the Great Society of Peasants on the eve of the revolt
of 1381. It shows how deep an impression the characters and allegorical
form of <i>Piers Plowman</i> had made on the oppressed serfs and labourers,
and it gives some idea of the vague and incoherent thinking that brought
ruin on their enterprise. Ball, who had defied established authority all
his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> life, was freed from prison by the rebels, became a ringleader, and
preached to their assembly on Blackheath a famous sermon with the text:</p>



<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">When Adam dalf, and Eve span,</p>
<p class="verse">Who was then the gentleman?</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">A few weeks later he was executed by sentence of Lord Chief Justice
Tressilian, who had been charged by the King to take vengeance on the
rebels.</p>

<p>The distich E sums up briefly the history of a year which turned
moderate men against Richard II. A fuller contemporary picture of the
events that led to his deposition is found in the alliterative poem
<i>Richard the Redeles</i>, attributed by Skeat to the author of <i>Piers
Plowman</i>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XV"></a>XV</span>
<span>MISCELLANEOUS PIECES IN VERSE</span>
</h2>



<p>Under this head are grouped a number of short poems, representing forms
of composition that survive only by fortunate chance.</p>

<p>A is a curious little song, which has been printed from Hale MS. 135 by
G. E. Woodbine in <i>Modern Language Review</i>, vol. iv, p. 236, and
reconstructed by Skeat at vol. v, p. 105, of the same periodical.</p>

<p>B and C are the best-known lyrics of the important collection edited by
Böddeker, <i>Altenglische Dichtungen des MS. Harley 2253</i>, Berlin 1878.
They are literary and rather artificial in form.</p>

<p>D and E are minstrels' songs found, among other popular snatches, on a
fly-leaf of Bodleian MS. Rawlinson D. 913, and edited by Heuser in
<i>Anglia</i>, vol. xxx, p. 173. In E lines 14-16 and ll. 17-19 are to be
expanded on the model of ll. 7-13.</p>

<p>All these songs are early, and have a lightness and gaiety that become
rare as the fourteenth century advances.</p>

<p>F is one of several English scraps (ed. Furnivall in <i>Political,
Religious, and Love Poems</i>, E.E.T.S., pp. 249 ff.) that are found
scattered through the Latin text of MS. Harley 7322. Most of the English
pieces are without poetical merit, but in this one poem the writer has
attained a perfect simplicity.</p>

<p>G, printed in Wright and Halliwell's <i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, 1845, vol. i,
p. 144, has been recognized as the first of the English ballads. It is
the only example before 1400 of the swift and dramatic movement, the
sudden transitions, and the restrained expression, characteristic of the
ballad style.</p>

<p>H, first printed in <i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, vol. i, p. 240, is the latest
of the short pieces. With onomatopoeic effects it gives a vivid if
unfriendly picture of a blacksmith's forge on a busy night.</p>

<p>I is a charm edited by Furnivall at p. 43 of the E.E.T.S. volume in
which F appears.</p>

<span>THE YORK PLAY 'HARROWING OF HELL'</span>
<span class="smaller">British Museum MS. Addit. 35290 (about 1430-40), f. 193 b.</span>
</h2>

<p>The miracle play <i>Harrowing of Hell</i> is assigned to the craft of
Saddlers in the York cycle, edited by Miss L. Toulmin-Smith, Oxford
1885, pp. 372 ff. This is the text reproduced below. It is also found,
though in a less perfect form, among the <i>Towneley Plays</i>, ed. England
and Pollard, E.E.T.S., 1897, pp. 293 ff.</p>

<p>All the mediaeval stories of Christ's Descent into Hell are based on the
gospel of Nicodemus, which seems to date from the fourth century, though
the legend is referred to nearly two centuries earlier. This apocryphal
narrative was popular throughout the Middle Ages. There is a prose
translation in late Anglo-Saxon, and a Middle English verse rendering
supplies some of the phrases in the play.</p>

<p>Two points deserve notice for their bearing on the development of
miracles. A trace of their origin in the services of the Church is seen
in the use made of the Scriptural passage 'Attollite portas, principes,
vestras, et elevamini portae aeternales, et introibit rex gloriae', the
dramatic possibilities of which were recognized in ritual from an early
date. And the growing taste for comic scenes is met, without prejudice
to the serious characters, by the rudimentary buffoonery of the Devil
and his companions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="XVII"></a>XVII</span>
<span>THE TOWNELEY PLAY OF NOAH</span>
<span class="smaller">Towneley MS. (about 1475), ff. 76 ff.</span>
</h2>


<p>The Towneley Miracles, so called because the manuscript belonged in
recent times to the library of Towneley Hall in Lancashire, are edited
by England and Pollard, E.E.T.S., 1897. The cycle is a composite
one—for instance it includes a later form of the York play <i>Harrowing
of Hell</i> (No. XVI, above)—but it is distinguished by a group of plays
and interpolated scenes which seem to have been specially composed for
representation at Wakefield. Formally this group is marked by the use of
a peculiar nine-lined stanza, riming a a a a b c c c b, with central
rimes in the first four lines. The rough vigour of the comic scenes is
still more distinctive, and there can be little doubt that all are the
work of one man. The specimen of his style most often reprinted is <i>The
Second Shepherd's Play</i>, which has an original and purely secular comic
plot. The <i>Play of Noah</i> is more typical of the English Miracle in its
later development. This subject was always popular with early
playwrights, for the Ark made a spectacle, and the traditional quarrels
of Noah and his wife gave scope for contests in fisticuffs and rough
raillery—the stuff of primitive comedy.</p>

<p>The inflexions are very much simplified as compared with those of the
Kentish <i>Ayenbyte</i> (III), but the verse shows that final unaccented <i>-e</i>
was better preserved in the original than in our late MS., e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>And specyaly at hygh&lt;ė&gt; tymės</i> <span class="ind2">13.</span></p>

</div>

<p><b>Sounds</b>: <i>ǭ</i> is regular for OE. <i>ā</i>: <i>lothe</i> 9, <i>wroth</i> 10, &amp;c.;
but the only decisive rime is <i>also</i> (OE. <i>alswā</i>): <i>to</i> (OE.
<i>tō</i>) 35-6, where <i>ǭ</i> after <i>(s)w</i> has become close <i>ọ̄</i>; see
Appendix § 8. ii, note.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b>: the loose constructions, e.g. ll. 15 ff. (note), 134-5, 138-9,
216-19, are characteristic of the period.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>The history of this legend is traced by E. Schröder, <i>Zeitschrift für
Kirchengeschichte</i>, vol. xvii, 1896, pp. 94 ff., and, more summarily, by
Gaston Paris, <i>Les Danseurs maudits</i>, Paris 1900. The circumstances from
which it sprang appear to belong to the year 1021. Kölbigk, in Anhalt,
Saxony, was the scene of the dance. In 1074 it is referred to as
'famous' by a German chronicler, who records the healing of one of the
dancers in 1038 through the miraculous powers of St. Wigbert.</p>

<p>Mendicants who suffered from or could simulate nervous diseases like St.
Vitus's dance, were quick to realize their opportunity, and two letters
telling the story were circulated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> as credentials by pretended survivors
of the band. Both are influenced in form by a sermon of St. Augustine of
Hippo which embodies a similar story (Migne, <i>Patrologia</i>, vol. xxxviii,
col. 1443). The first (Letter of Otbert), which claims to be issued by
Peregrinus bishop of Cologne, spread rapidly through Western Europe.
This was the version that Mannyng found in William of Wadington. The
second (Letter of Theodric) makes Bruno bishop of Toul, afterwards Pope
Leo IX, vouch for the facts. It was incorporated in the account of the
miraculous cure of Theodric at the shrine of St. Edith of Wilton, and is
known only from English sources. This was the text that Mannyng used. A
later English version, without merit, is found in the dreary
fifteenth-century <i>Life of St. Editha</i> (ed. Horstmann, ll. 4063 ff.).</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>1 ff. <i>games</i>: Dances and shows in the churchyard were constantly
condemned by the Church in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In
1287 a synod at Exeter rules <i>ne quisquam luctas, choreas, vel alios
ludos inhonestos in coemeteriis exercere praesumat, praecipue in
vigiliis et festis sanctorum</i>. See Chambers, <i>The Mediaeval Stage</i>, vol.
i, pp. 90 ff.</p>

<p>6. <i>or tabure bete</i>: Note the use of <i>bete</i> infin. as a verbal noun =
<i>betyng</i>; cp. <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 184-5.</p>

<p>10-12. 'And he (<i>sc.</i> a good priest) will become angered sooner than one
who has no learning, and who does not understand Holy Writ.'</p>

<p>15 ff. <i>noght... none</i>: An accumulation of negatives in ME. makes the
negation more emphatic. Here the writer wavers between two forms of
expression: (1) 'do not sing carols in holy places', and (2) 'to sing
carols in holy places is sacrilege'.</p>

<p>25-8. <i>yn þys londe</i>, &amp;c. The cure of Theodric, not the dance, took
place in England. Brightgiva is said to have been abbess of Wilton at
the time (1065), and 'King Edward' is Edward the Confessor (1042-66).</p>

<p>34-5. The church of Kölbigk is dedicated to St. Magnus, of whom nothing
certain is known. The memory of St. Bukcestre, if ever there was such a
saint, appears to be preserved only in this story.</p>

<p>36. <i>þat þey come to</i>: Construe with <i>hyt</i> in l. 35.</p>

<p>37 ff. <i>Here names of alle</i>: The twelve followers of Gerlew are named in
the Latin text, but Mannyng gives only the principal actors. The
inconsistency is still more marked in the Bodleian MS., which after l.
40 adds:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Þe ouþer twelue here names alle</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Þus were þey wrete, as y can kalle.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Otherwise the Bodleian MS. is very closely related to the Harleian,
sharing most of its errors and peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>44. <i>þe prestes doghtyr of þe tounne</i>, 'the priest of the town's
daughter'. In early ME. the genitive inflexion is not, as in Modern
English, added to the last of a group of words: cp. <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>d</i> 10 <i>Þe
Kynges sone of heuene</i> 'the King of Heaven's son'. The same construction
occurs in <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 19 <i>for þe Lordes loue of heuene</i> = 'for the love of
the Lord of Heaven', and in <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 214; but in these passages the
genitive is objective, and Modern English does not use the inflexion at
all (note to <span class="smaller">I</span> 83). The ME. and modern expressions have their point of
agreement in the position of the genitive inflexion, which always
precedes immediately the noun on which the genitive depends. Cp. notes
to <span class="smaller">II</span> 518,<span class="smaller">VI</span> 23, and <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>d</i> 1.</p>

<p>46. <i>Aȝone</i>: <i>ȝ</i> = <i>z</i> here. The name is <i>Azo</i> in the Latin.</p>

<p>55. <i>Beu&lt;u&gt;ne</i>: (derived from the accusative <i>Beuonem</i>) = <i>Beuo</i> of
l. 59 and <i>Beuolyne</i> of l. 62. The form is properly <i>Bovo</i> not <i>Bevo</i>.
Considerable liberties were taken with proper names to adapt them to
metre or rime: e.g. l. 52 <i>Merswynde</i>; l. 63 <i>Merswyne</i>; cp. note to l.
246. This habit, and frequent miscopying, make it difficult to rely on
names in mediaeval stories.</p>

<p>65. <i>Grysly</i>: An error for <i>Gerlew</i>, Latin <i>Gerleuus</i>, from Low German
<i>Gērlēf</i> = OE. <i>Gārlāf</i>.</p>

<p>83. <i>for Crystys awe</i>: In Modern English a phrase like <i>Christ's awe</i>
could mean only 'the awe felt by Christ'. But in OE. <i>Cristes ege</i>, or
<i>ege Cristes</i>, meant also 'the awe of Christ (which men feel)', the
genitive being objective. In ME. the word order <i>eie Cristes</i> is
dropped, but <i>Cristes eie</i> (or <i>awe</i>, the Norse form) is still regular
for '(men's) fear of Christ'. Hence formal ambiguities like <i>þe Lordes
loue of heuene</i> <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 19, which actually means '(men's) love of the
Lord of Heaven', but grammatically might mean 'the Lord of Heaven's love
(for men)'—see note to l. 44 above.</p>

<p>96-7. The Latin Letter of Theodric in fact has <i>ab isto officio ex Dei
nutu amodo non cessetis</i>, but probably <i>amodo</i> is miswritten for <i>anno</i>.</p>

<p>127. <i>a saue</i>: lit. 'have safe', i.e. 'rescue'. <i>Saue</i> is here adj.</p>

<p>128-9. <i>ys</i>: <i>flessh</i>: The rime requires the alternative forms <i>es</i> (as
in l. 7) and <i>fles(s)</i>. Cp. note to <span class="smaller">VII</span> 4.</p>

<p>132. <i>Ȝow þar nat aske</i>: 'There is no need for you to ask'; <i>ȝow</i>
is dative after the impersonal <i>þar</i>.</p>

<p>156-7. <i>werynes</i>: <i><a id="dos"></a>dos</i>. The rime is false. Perhaps Mannyng wrote: <i>As
many body for goyng es</i> [sc. <i>wery</i>], and a copyist misplaced <i>es</i>,
writing: <i>As many body es for goyng</i>. If <i>body es</i> were read as
<i>bodyes</i>, a new verb would then be added.</p>

<p>169. Note the irony of the refrain. The Letter of Otbert adds the
picturesque detail that they gradually sank up to their waists in the
ground through dancing on the same spot.</p>

<p>172.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> <i>Þe Emperoure Henry</i>: Probably Henry II of Germany, Emperor from
1014 to 1024. A certain vagueness in points of time and place would save
the bearers of the letter from awkward questions.</p>

<p>188-9. <i>banned</i>: <i>woned</i>. The rime (OE. <i>bannan</i> and <i>wunian</i>) is false,
and the use of <i>woned</i> 'remained' is suspicious. Mannyng perhaps wrote
<i>bende</i> 'put in bonds': <i>wende</i> (= <i>ȝede</i> l. 191) 'went'; or (if the
form <i>band</i> for <i>banned(e)</i> could be evidenced so early) <i>band</i>
'cursed': <i>wand</i>, pret. of <i>winden</i>, 'went'.</p>

<p>195. <i>fal yn a swone</i>: So MS., showing that by the second half of the
fourteenth century the pp. adj. <i>aswon</i> had been wrongly analysed into
the indef. article <i>a</i> and a noun <i>swon</i>. Mannyng may have written
<i>fallen aswone</i>. See Glossary, <i>s.v.</i> <i>aswone</i>.</p>

<p>234. <i>Wyth sundyr lepys</i>: 'with separate leaps'; but <i>Wyth</i> was probably
added by a scribe who found in his original <i>sundyrlepys</i>, adv., meaning
'separately',—</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Kar suvent par les mains</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Des malvais escrivains</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Sunt livre corrumput.</i></p>

</div>

<p>240. <i>Seynt Edyght.</i> St. Edith (d. 984) was daughter of King Edgar, and
abbess of Wilton. The rime is properly <i>Edit</i>: <i>Teodric</i>, for <i>t</i> and
<i>k</i> are sufficiently like in sound to rime together in the best ME.
verse; cp. note to <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 27.</p>

<p>246. <i>Brunyng... seynt Tolous</i>: Latin <i>Bruno Tullanus</i>. Robert probably
did not hesitate to provide a rime by turning Toul into Toulouse. Bruno
afterwards became Pope Leo IX (1049-54).</p>

<p>254-5. <i>trowed</i>: <i>God</i>. Read <i>trŏd</i>, a shortened form, revealed by
rimes in North Midland texts. The identical rime occurs three times in
Mannyng's <i>Chronicle</i> (ed. Hearne, p. 339; ed. Furnivall, ll. 7357-8,
8111-12); and, again with substitution of <i>troud</i> for <i>trod</i>, in
<i>Havelok</i>, ll. 2338-9. Cp. note to XVII 56.</p>

<p><b>Sounds</b>: <i>ǭ</i> for OE. <i>ā</i> is proved in rime: <i>biholde</i> (OE.
<i>beháldan</i>): <i>gold</i> (OE. <i>góld</i>) 367-8 (cp. 467-8); and <i>yhote</i> (OE.
<i>gehāten</i>): <i>note</i> (OFr. <i>note</i>) 601-2.</p>

<p>The rime <i>frut</i>: <i>lite</i> 257-8 points to original <i>frut</i>: <i>lut</i> (OE.
<i>lȳt</i>), with Western <i>ǖ</i>, from OE. <i>ȳ</i>, riming with OFr.
<i>ǖ</i>.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>1-22. These lines, found also in <i>Lai le Freine</i>, would serve as preface
to any of the Breton lays, with the couplet ll. 23-4 as the special
connecting link. In the Auchinleck MS., <i>Orfeo</i> begins on a fresh leaf
at l. 25, without heading or capitals to indicate that it is a new poem.
The leaf preceding has been lost. There is good reason to suppose that
it contained the lines supplied in the text from the Harleian MS.</p>

<p>4. <i>frely</i>, 'goodly': <i>Lai le Freine</i> has <i>ferly</i> 'wondrous'.</p>

<p>12. MS. <i>moost to lowe</i>: means 'most (worthy) to be praised', and there
are two or three recorded examples of <i>to lowe</i> = <i>to alowe</i> in this
sense. But MS. Ashmole and the corresponding lines in <i>Lai le Freine</i>
point to <i>most o loue</i> 'mostly of love' as the common reading. The
typical 'lay' is a poem of moderate length, telling a story of love,
usually with some supernatural element, in a refined and courtly style.</p>

<p>13. <i>Brytayn</i>, 'Brittany': so <i>Brytouns</i> 16 = 'Bretons'. Cp. Chaucer,
<i>Franklin's Tale, Prologue</i>, beginning</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Thise olde gentil Britons in hir dayes</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Of diverse aventures maden layes</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Rymeyed in hir firste Briton tonge,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Whiche layes with hir instrumentz they songe</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>20. The curious use of <i>it</i> after the plural <i>layes</i> is perhaps not
original. <i>Lai le Freine</i> has: <i>And maked a lay and yaf it name</i>.</p>

<p>26. <i>In Inglond</i>: an alteration of the original text to give local
colour. Cp. ll. 49-50 and l. 478.</p>

<p>29-30. <i>Pluto</i>: the King of Hades came to be regarded as the King of
Fairyland; cp. Chaucer, <i>Merchant's Tale</i>, l. 983 <i>Pluto that is the
kyng of fairye</i>. The blunder by which Juno is made a king is apparently
peculiar to the Auchinleck copy.</p>

<p>33-46. These lines are not in the Auchinleck MS., but are probably
authentic. Otherwise little prominence would be given to Orfeo's skill
as a harper.</p>

<p>41 ff. A confused construction: <i>In þe world was neuer man born</i> should
be followed by <i>&lt;þat&gt; he &lt;ne&gt; schulde þinke</i>; but the writer goes on as
if he had begun with 'every man in the world'. <i>And</i> = 'if'.</p>

<p>46. <i>ioy and</i> overload the verse, and are probably an unskilful addition
to the text.</p>

<p>49-50. These lines are peculiar to the Auchinleck MS., and are clearly
interpolated; cp. l. 26 and l. 478. Winchester was the old capital of
England, and therefore the conventional seat of an English king.</p>

<p>57. <i>comessing</i>: The metre points to a disyllabic form <i>comsing</i> here,
and to <i>comsi</i> in l. 247.</p>

<p>80. <i>it bled wete</i>: In early English the clause which is logically
subordinate is sometimes made formally co-ordinate. More normal would be
<i>þat (it) bled wete</i> 'until (<i>or</i> so that) it bled wet'; i.e. until it
was wet with blood.</p>

<p>82. <i>reuey&lt;se&gt;d</i> or some such form of <i>ravished</i> is probably right.
<i>reneyd</i> 'apostate' is a possible reading of the MS., but does not fit
the sense. <i>N. E. D.</i> suggests <i>remeued</i>.</p>

<p>102. <i>what is te?</i>: 'What ails you?; cp. l. 115. <i>Te</i> for <i>þe</i> after <i>s</i>
of <i>is</i>. Such modifications are due either to dissimilation of like
sounds, as <i>þ</i>: <i>s</i> which are difficult in juxtaposition; or to
assimilation of unlike sounds, as <i>þatow</i> 165, for <i>þat þow</i>.</p>

<p>115. 'What ails you, and how it came about?'; cp. l. 102.</p>

<p>129. <i>ichil</i> = <i>ich wille</i>; and so <i>ichaue</i> 209, <i>icham</i> 382, <i>ichot</i> <span class="smaller">XV</span>
<i>b</i> 23. These forms, reduced to <i>chill</i>, <i>cham</i>, &amp;c., were still
characteristic of the Southern dialect in Shakespeare's time: cp. <i>King
Lear</i>, <span class="smaller">IV</span>. vi. 239 <i>Chill not let go, Zir</i>.</p>

<p>131. <i>þat nouȝt nis</i>: 'That cannot be'; cp. l. 457 <i>þat nouȝt
nere</i>.</p>

<p>157-8. <i>palays</i>: <i>ways</i>. The original rime was perhaps <i>palys</i>: <i>wys</i>
'wise'.</p>

<p>170. 'Wherever you may be, you shall be fetched.'</p>

<p>201-2. <i>barouns</i>: <i>renouns</i>. Forms like <i>renouns</i> in rime are usually
taken over from a French original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>215. The overloaded metre points to a shorter word like <i>wite</i> for
<i>vnderstond</i>.</p>

<p>216. <i>Make ȝou þan a parlement</i>: <i>ȝou</i> is not nom., but dat. 'for
yourselves'. Observe that Orfeo acts like a constitutional English king.</p>

<p>241. <i>þe fowe and griis</i>: A half translation of OFr. <i>vair et gris</i>.
<i>Vair</i> (Lat. <i>varius</i>) was fur made of alternate pieces of the grey back
and white belly of the squirrel. Hence it is rendered by <i>fowe</i>, OE.
<i>fāg</i> 'varicolor'. <i>Griis</i> is the grey back alone, and the French
word is retained for the rime with <i>biis</i>, which was probably in the
OFr. original.</p>

<p>258. <i>berien</i>: The MS. may be read <i>berren</i>, but as this form is
incorrect it is better to assume that the <i>i</i> has been carelessly shaped
by the scribe.</p>

<p>289. <i>him se</i>, 'see (for himself), and similarly <i>slep þou þe</i> <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i>
13. This reflexive use of the dative pronoun, which cannot be reproduced
in a modern rendering, is common in OE. and ME., especially with verbs
of motion; cp. note to <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 24. But distinguish <i>went him</i> 475, 501,
where <i>him</i> is accusative, not dative (OE. <i>wente hine</i>), because the
original sense of <i>went</i> is 'turned', which naturally takes a reflexive
object.</p>

<p>342. <i>me no reche</i> = <i>I me no reche</i>. The alternative would be the
impersonal <i>me no recheþ</i>.</p>

<p>343. <i>also spac</i> = <i>also bliue</i> 142 = <i>also swiþe</i> 574: 'straightway',
&amp;c.</p>

<p>363. MS. <i>auowed</i> (or <i>anowed</i>) is meaningless here. <i>Anow&lt;rn&gt;ed</i>, or
the doubtful by-form <i>anow&lt;r&gt;ed</i> 'adorned', is probably the true
reading.</p>

<p>382. The line is too long—a fault not uncommon where direct speech is
introduced, e.g. l. 419 and 178. Usually a correct line can be obtained
by dropping words like <i>quath he</i>, which are not as necessary in spoken
verse as they are where writing alone conveys the sense. But sometimes
the flaw may lie in the forms of address: l. 382 would be normal without
<i>Parfay</i>; l. 419 may once have been:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>And seyd 'Lord, ȝif þi wille were'.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">There is no task more slippery than the metrical reconstruction of ME.
poems, particularly those of which the extant text derives from the
original not simply through a line of copyists, but through a line of
minstrels who passed on the verses from memory and by word of mouth.</p>

<p>388. The line seems to be corrupt, and, as usual, the Harleian and
Ashmole MSS. give little help. <i>Ful</i> can hardly be a sb. meaning
'multitude' from the adj. <i>full</i>. Some form of <i>fele</i> (OE. <i>fela</i>) 'a
great number' would give possible grammar and sense (cp. l. 401), but
bad metre. Perhaps <i>ful</i> should be deleted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> as a scribe's anticipation
of <i>folk</i> in the next line; for the construction <i>seiȝe... of folk</i>
cp. <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 388; and <i>Hous of Fame</i>, Bk. iii, ll. 147 ff.</p>

<p>433. <i>Þei we nouȝt welcom no be</i>: Almost contemporary with <i>Sir
Orfeo</i> is the complaint of an English writer that the halls of the
nobles stood open to a lawyer, but not to a poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Exclusus ad ianuam poteris sedere</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Ipse licet venias, Musis comitatus, Homere!</i></p>
</div>

<p>'Though thou came thyself, Homer, with all the Muses, thou mightst sit
at the door, shut out!', T. Wright, <i>Political Songs</i> (1839), p. 209.</p>

<p>446. <i>hadde he</i>, 'had she'. For <i>he</i> (OE. <i>hēo</i>) = 'she' cp. l. 408.</p>

<p>450. 'Now ask of me whatsoever it may be'. The plots of mediaeval
romances often depend on the unlimited promises of an unwary king, whose
honour compels him to keep his word. So in the story of Tristram, an
Irish noble disguised as a minstrel wins Ysolde from King Mark by this
same device, but is himself cheated of his prize by Tristram's skill in
music.</p>

<p>458. 'An ill-matched pair you two would be!'</p>

<p>479. The halting verse may be completed by adding <i>sum tyme</i> before
<i>his</i>, with the Harley and Ashmole MSS.</p>

<p>483. <i>ybilt</i> of the MS. and editors cannot well be a pp. meaning
'housed'. I prefer to take <i>bilt</i> as sb. = <i>bild</i>, <i>build</i> 'a building';
and to suppose that <i>y</i> has been miswritten for <i>ȳ</i>, the contraction
for <i>yn</i>.</p>

<p>495. <i>gan hold</i>, 'held'; a good example of the ME. use of <i>gan</i> +
infinitive with the sense of the simple preterite.</p>

<p>515. An unhappy suggestion <i>home</i> for the second <i>come</i> has sometimes
been accepted. But a careful Southern poet could not rime <i>home</i> (OE.
<i>hām</i>) and <i>some</i> (OE. <i>sŭm</i>). See note to <span class="smaller">VI</span> 224.</p>

<p>518. <i>For mi lordes loue Sir Orfeo</i>, 'for my lord Sir Orfeo's love'.
Logically the genitive inflexion should be added to both of two
substantives in apposition, as in OE. <i>on Herodes dagum cyninges</i> 'in
the days of King Herod'. But in ME. the first substantive usually has
the inflexion, and the second is uninflected; cp. <span class="smaller">V</span>  207 <i>kyngeȝ hous
Arthor</i> 'the house of King Arthur'; and notes to <span class="smaller">I</span> 44, <span class="smaller">VI</span> 23.</p>

<p>544. <i>Allas! wreche</i>: <i>wreche</i> refers to the speaker, as in l. 333.</p>

<p>551. <i>hou it geþ—</i>: The sense is hard to convey without some cumbrous
paraphrase like 'the inexorable law of this world—'.</p>

<p>552. <i>It nis no bot of manes deþ</i>: 'There is no remedy for man's death',
i.e. violent grief will do no good. Note <i>it nis</i> 'there is (not)'. In
ME. the anticipated subject is commonly <i>it</i> where we use <i>there</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>565. <i>in ynome</i>: '&lt;had&gt; taken up my abode'; <i>in</i> 'dwelling' = NE. 'inn'.</p>

<p>599. <i>herof</i> overloads the line and is omitted in the Ashmole MS.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>3. Saint Germain of Auxerre (MS. <i>Aucerne</i>) is famous for his missions
to Britain in the first half of the fifth century. This particular story
is found in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> for July 31, p. 229.</p>

<p>16. St. John the Almoner (d. 616) was bishop of Alexandria. For the
story see <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> for January 23, p. 115.</p>

<p>27-8. <i>and huanne he hit wiste þe ilke zelue þet his hedde onderuonge</i>:
an obscure sentence. Perhaps: 'and when he, the same who had received
them (i.e. John, who had received the five hundred pounds), knew it'
(sc. the truth).</p>

<p>38. This tale of Boniface, bishop of Ferentia in Etruria, is told in the
<i>Dialogues</i> of Gregory the Great, Bk. i, chap. 9. Its first appearance
in English is in the translation of the <i>Dialogues</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> made by Bishop
Wærferth for King Alfred (ed. Hans Hecht, Leipzig 1900, pp. 67 ff.).</p>

<p>48-60. The French original of the passage, taken from an elegant
fourteenth-century MS., Cotton Cleopatra A.V., fol. 144 a, will show how
slavishly Dan Michael followed his source:—</p>

<p><i>Apres il fu un poure home, sicom on dit, qui auoit une vache; e oi dire
a son prestre en sarmon que Dieu disoit en leuangile que Dieu rendoit a
cent doubles quanque on donast por lui. Le prodomme du conseil sa femme
dona sa uache a son prestre, qui estoit riches. Le prestre la prist
uolentiers, e lenuoia pestre auoec les autres quil auoit. Kant uint au
soir, la uache au poure home sen uint a son hostel chies le poure homme,
com ele auoit acoustume, e amena auoeques soi toutes les uaches au
prestre, iukes a cent. Quant le bon home uit ce, si pensa que ce estoit
le mot de leuangile que li auoit rendu; e li furent aiugiees deuant son
euesque contre le prestre. Cest ensample moustre bien que misericorde
est bone marchande, car ele multiplie les biens temporels.</i></p>

<p>58-9. 'And they were adjudged to him before his bishop against the
priest', i.e. the bishop ruled that the poor man should have all the
cows.</p>

<p>The French <i>fabliau</i> '<i>Brunain</i>' takes up the comic rather than the
moral aspect of the story. A peasant, hearing the priest say that gifts
to God are doubly repaid, thought it was a favourable opportunity to
give his cow Blérain—a poor milker—to the priest. The priest ties her
with his own cow Brunain. To the peasant's great joy, the unprofitable
Blérain returns home, leading with her the priest's good cow.</p>

<p><i>a.</i>This poem is largely a translation of sentences excerpted from
Rolle's Incendium Amoris, cc. xl-xli (Miss Allen in Mod. Lang. Review
for 1919, p. 320). Useful commentaries are his prose <i>Form of Perfect
Living</i> (ed. Horstmann, vol. i, pp. 3 ff.), and <i>Commandment of Love
to God</i> (ibid. pp. 61 ff.), which supply many parallels in thought and
phrasing; see, for example, the note to l. 48 below.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p><i>a</i> 1. <i>feste.</i> Not the adj. 'fast', but pp. 'fastened', and so in l.
82.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 5. <i>louyng</i>, 'beloved one', here and in l. 56. This exceptional use
of the verbal noun occurs again in <i>my ȝhernyng</i> 'what I yearn for',
<i>a</i> 22; <i>my couaytyng</i> 'what I covet', <i>a</i> 23.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 9-12. The meaning seems to be: 'The throne of love is raised high,
for it (i.e. love) ascended into heaven. It seems to me that on earth
love is hidden, which makes men pale and wan. It goes very near to the
bed of bliss (i.e. the bridal bed of Christ and the soul) I assure you.
Though the way may seem long to us, yet love unites God and man.'</p>

<p><i>a</i> 24. <i>louyng</i>, 'praise' here and in <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 405, from OE. <i>lof</i> 'praise';
quite distinct from <i>louyng</i>, <i>lufyng</i>, in ll. 5 and 56.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 36. <i>fle þat na man it maye</i>, 'which no man can escape'. See
Appendix § 12, Relative.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 42. <i>styll</i>, 'always' rather than 'motionless'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 43-4. Apparently 'the nature of love (<i>þat kyend</i>) turns from care
the man (<i>þe lyfe</i>) who succeeds in finding love, or who ever knew it in
his heart; and brings him to joy and delight.'</p>

<p><i>a</i> 48. Cp. <i>Form of Perfect Living</i>, ed. Horstmann, vol. i, pp. 39-40:
<i>For luf es stalworth als þe dede, þat slaes al lyuand thyng in erth;
and hard als hell, þat spares noght till þam þat er dede.</i> In <i>The
Commandment of Love</i> Rolle explains: <i>For als dede slas al lyuand thyng
in þis worlde, sa perfite lufe slas in a mans sawle all fleschly desyres
and erthly couaytise. And als hell spares noght til dede men, bot
tormentes al þat commes bartill, alswa a man þat es in þis</i> [sc. the
third, called 'Singular'] <i>degré of lufe noght anly he forsakes þe
wretched solace of þis lyf, bot alswa he couaytes to sofer pynes for
Goddes lufe.</i> (Ibid. p. 63.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span><i>b</i> 4. <i>scho takes erthe</i>: From the <i>Historia Animalium</i> attributed to
Aristotle, Bk. ix, c. 21. This is the authority referred to at l. 18,
and at l. 33 (Bk. ix, c. 9); but the citations seem to be second hand,
as they do not agree closely with the text of the <i>Historia Animalium</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 21-2. 'For there are many who never can keep the rule of love
towards their friends, whether kinsmen or not.' MS. <i>ynesche</i> has been
variously interpreted; but it must be corrected to <i>ynence</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 47. <i>strucyo or storke</i>: the ostrich, not the stork, is meant. Latin
<i>struthio</i> has both meanings. On the whole, fourteenth-century
translators show a fair knowledge of Latin, but the average of
scholarship, even among the clergy, was never high in the Middle Ages.
In the magnificent Eadwine Psalter, written at Canterbury Cathedral in
the twelfth century, Ps. ci. 7 <i>similis factus sum pellicano</i> is
rendered by 'I am become like to the skin of a dog' (= <i>pelli canis</i>),
though an ecclesiastic would recite this psalm in Latin at least once
every week. The records of some thirteenth-century examinations of
English clergy may be found in G. G. Coulton, <i>A Medieval Garner</i>
(London 1910), pp. 270 ff. They include the classic answer of Simon, the
curate of Sonning, who, being examined on the Canon of the Mass, and
pressed to say what governed <i>Te</i> in <i>Te igitur, clementissime Pater,...
supplices rogamus</i>, replied '<i>Pater</i>, for He governeth all things'. As
for French, Michael of Northgate, a shaky translator, is fortunate in
escaping gross blunders in the specimen chosen (<span class="smaller">III</span>); but the English
rendering of Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> is full of errors; see the notes to
<span class="smaller">IX</span>.</p>

<p><b>Alliterative Verse.</b> The long lines in <i>Gawayne</i>, with <i>The Destruction
of Troy</i>, <i>Piers Plowman</i>, and <i>The Blacksmiths</i> (<span class="smaller">XV</span>  <i>h</i>), are specimens
of alliterative verse unmixed with rime, a form strictly comparable with
Old English verse, from which it must derive through an unbroken oral
tradition. While the detailed analysis of the Middle English
alliterative line is complex and controversial, its general framework is
describable in simple terms. It will be convenient to take examples from
<i>Gawayne</i>, which shows most of the developments characteristic of Middle
English.</p>

<p>1. The long line is divided by a caesura into two half lines, of which
the second is the more strictly built so that the rhythm may be well
marked. Each half line normally contains two principal stresses, e.g.</p>



<div class="poem">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>And wént on his wáy || with his wýȝe óne</i> <span class="ind2">6.</span></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>Þat schulde téche hym to tóurne || to þat téne pláce</i> <span class="ind2">7.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But three stresses are not uncommonly found in the first half line:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>Brókeȝ býled and bréke || bi bónkkeȝ abóute</i> <span class="ind2">14;</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and, even for the simpler forms in Old and Middle English, the
two-stress analysis has its opponents.</p>

<p>2. The two half lines are bound together by alliteration. In
alliteration <i>ch</i>, <i>st</i>, <i>s(c)h</i>, <i>sk</i>, and usually <i>sp</i>, are treated as
single consonants (see lines 64, 31, 15, 99, 25); any vowel may
alliterate with any other vowel, e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>Þis </i>ó<i>ritore is </i>v́<i>gly || with </i>é<i>rbeȝ ouergrówen</i>  <span class="ind2">122;</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and, contrary to the practice of correct OE. verse, <i>h</i> may alliterate
with vowels in <i>Gawayne</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse">H<i>álde þe now þe </i>h<i>ýȝe </i>h<i>óde || þat </i>Á<i>rþur þe ráȝt</i> <span class="ind2"> 229.</span></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>The </i>h<i>áþel </i>h<i>éldet hym fró || and on his </i>á<i>x résted</i>  <span class="ind2">263.</span></p>

</div>

<p>3. In correct OE. verse the alliteration falls on one or both of the two
principal stresses of the first half line, and invariably on the first
stress only of the second half line. This is the ordinary ME. type:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Þat schulde </i>t<i>éche hym to </i>t<i>óurne || to þat </i>t<i>éne pláce</i>   <span class="ind2">7;</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">though verses with only one alliterating syllable in the first half
line, e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Bot Í wyl to þe </i>ch<i>ápel || for </i>ch<i>áunce þat may fálle</i>    <span class="ind2"> 64,</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">are less common in ME. than in OE. But in ME. the fourth stress
sometimes takes the alliteration also:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Þay </i>cl<i>ómben bi </i>cl<i>ýffeȝ || þer </i>cl<i>éngeȝ þe </i>c<i>ólde</i> <span class="ind2">10.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And when there is a third stress in the first half line, five syllables
may alliterate:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">M<i>íst </i>m<i>úged on þe </i>m<i>ór || </i>m<i>ált on þe </i>m<i>óunteȝ</i> <span class="ind2">12.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In sum, Middle English verse is richer than Old English in alliteration.</p>

<p>4. In all these verses the alliteration of the first stress in the
second half line, which is essential in Old English, is maintained; but
it is sometimes neglected, especially when the alliteration is otherwise
well marked:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>With</i> h<i>éȝe</i> h<i>élme on his</i> h<i>éde</i> || <i>his láunce in his </i>h<i>ónde</i> <span class="ind2">(129; cp. 75)</span>,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">where the natural stress cannot fall on <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>5. So far attention has been confined to the stressed syllables, around
which the unstressed syllables are grouped. Clearly the richer the
alliteration, the more freedom will be possible in the treatment of the
unstressed syllables without undue weakening of the verse form. In the
first two lines of <i>Beowulf</i>—</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Hwæt we Gárdéna || in géardágum</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Þéodcýninga || þrým gefrúnon—</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">three of the half lines have the minimum number of syllables—four—and
the other has only five. In Middle English, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> more elaborate
alliteration, the number of unstressed syllables is increased, so that
the minimum half line of four syllables is rare, and often contains some
word which may have had an additional flexional syllable in the poet's
own manuscript, e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse">|| <i>þe sélf&lt;e&gt; chápel</i>  <span class="ind2">79.</span></p>
<p class="verse">|| <i>árȝeȝ in hért&lt;e&gt;</i>  <span class="ind2">209.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The less regular first half line is found with as many as eleven
syllables; e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>And syþen he kéuereȝ bi a crágge</i> || <span class="ind2">153.</span></p>

</div>

<p>6. The grouping of stressed and unstressed syllables determines the
rhythm. In Old English the falling rhythm predominates, as in || <i>Gáwayn
þe nóble</i> 81; and historically it is no doubt correct to trace the
development of the ME. line from a predominantly falling rhythm. But in
fact, owing to the frequent use of unstressed syllables before the first
stress (even in the second half line where they are avoided in the OE.
falling rhythm) the commonest type is:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse">|| <i>and þe bróde ȝáteȝ</i> <span class="ind2"> 1,</span></p>
    <p class="verse">(×   ×   -́ ×  -́ ×)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which from a strictly Middle English standpoint may be analysed as a
falling rhythm with introductory syllables (× × | -́ × -́ ×), or as
a rising rhythm with a weak ending (× × -́ × -́ | ×). A careful
reader, accustomed to the usage of English verse, will have no
difficulty in following the movement, without entering into nice
technicalities of historical analysis.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Destruction of Troy</i> is more regular than <i>Gawayne</i> in its
versification, and better preserves the Old English tradition. <i>Piers
Plowman</i> is looser and nearer to prose, so that the alliteration
sometimes fails altogether, e.g. Extract <i>a</i> 95, 138. Such differences
in technique may depend on date, on locality, or on the taste, training,
or skill of the author.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p><b>Dialect</b>: West Midland of Lancashire or Cheshire. (There is evidence of
local knowledge in the account of Gawayne's ride in search of the Green
Chapel, ll. 691 ff. of the complete text.)</p>

<p><b>Vocabulary.</b> <i>Sir Gawayne</i> shows the characteristic vocabulary of
alliterative verse.</p>

<p>It is rich in number and variety of words—Norse, French, and native.
Besides common words like <i>race</i> 8, <i>wylle</i> 16, <i>kyrk</i> 128, <i>aȝ-</i> 267
(which displace native English forms <i>rēs</i>, <i>wylde</i>, <i>chyrche</i>,
<i>eie</i>), Norse gives <i>mug(g)ed</i> 12, <i>cayreȝ</i> 52, <i>scowtes</i> 99,
<i>skayned</i> 99, <i>wro</i> 154, <i>broþe</i> 165, <i>fyked</i> 206, <i>snyrt</i> 244, &amp;c.
French are <i>baret</i> 47, <i>oritore</i> 122, <i>fylor</i> 157, <i>giserne</i> 197,
<i>kauelacion</i> 207, <i>frounses</i> 238, &amp;c. <i>Myst-hakel</i> 13, <i>orpedly</i> 164 are
native words; while the rare <i>stryþe</i> 237 and <i>raþeled</i> 226 are of
doubtful origin.</p>

<p>Unless the alliteration is to be monotonous, there must be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> many
synonyms for common words like <i>man</i>, <i>kniȝt</i>: e.g. <i>burne</i> 3,
<i>wyȝe</i> 6, <i>lede</i> 27, <i>gome</i> 50, <i>freke</i> 57, <i>tulk</i> 65, <i>knape</i> 68,
<i>renk</i> 138, most of which survive only by reason of their usefulness in
alliterative formulae. Similarly, a number of verbs are used to express
the common idea 'to move (rapidly)': <i>boȝen</i> 9, <i>schowued</i> 15,
<i>wonnen</i> 23, <i>ferked</i> 105, <i>romeȝ</i> 130, <i>keuereȝ</i> 153, <i>whyrlande</i>
154, &amp;c. Here the group of synonyms arises from weakening of the
ordinary prose meanings; and this tendency to use words in colourless or
forced senses is a general defect of alliterative verse. For instance,
it is hard to attach a precise meaning to <i>note</i> 24, <i>gedereȝ</i> 92,
<i>glodes</i> 113, <i>wruxled</i> 123, <i>kest</i> 308.</p>

<p>The <i>Gawayne</i> poet is usually artist enough to avoid the worst fault of
alliterative verse—the use of words for mere sound without regard to
sense, but there are signs of the danger in the empty, clattering line:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>Bremly broþe on a bent þat brode watȝ aboute</i> <span class="ind2">165.</span></p>

</div>

<p><b>Inflexions</b>: The rime <i>waþe</i>: <i>ta þe</i> 287-9 shows that organic
final <i>-e</i> was sometimes pronounced in the poet's dialect.</p>

<p><b>Sounds</b>: <i>ǭ</i> for older <i>ā</i> is common, and is proved for the
original by rimes like <i>more</i>: <i>restore</i> (OFr. <i>restorer</i>) 213-15,
<i>þore</i>: <i>restore</i> 286-8. But <i>a</i> is often written in the MS.: <i>snaw</i> 20,
166 (note rimes), <i>halden</i> 29, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>u</i> for OE. <i>y</i>, characteristic of Western dialects, is found especially
in the neighbourhood of labial consonants: <i>spuryed</i> (OE. <i>spyrian</i>) 25;
<i>muryly</i> 268, 277; <i>munt</i> vb. 194 and sb. 282; beside <i>myntes</i> 284,
<i>lyfte</i> 78, <i>hille</i> 13.</p>

<p><i>u</i> for OE. <i>eo</i> (normal ME. <i>e</i>) is another Western feature: <i>burne</i> 3,
21, &amp;c., <i>rurde</i> 151.</p>

<p><i>aw</i> for OE. <i>ēow</i> (normal ME. <i>ew</i>, <i>ow</i>) as in <i>trawe</i> 44, <i>trawþe</i>
219, <i>rawþe</i> 136, is still found in some Northern dialects.</p>

<p><b>Spelling</b>: <i>ȝ</i> (= <i>z</i>) is commonly written for final <i>s</i>:
<i>bredeȝ</i> 3, &amp;c.;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>even when the final <i>s</i> is certainly voiceless as
in <i>forȝ</i>, 'force', 'torrent' 105, <i>(aȝ-)leȝ</i> 'fear-less' 267.
<i>tȝ</i> is written for <i>s</i> in monosyllabic verbal forms, where it
indicates the maintenance of voiceless final <i>s</i> under the stress (see
rimes to <i>hatȝ</i> 'has', <span class="smaller">VI</span> 81): <i>watȝ</i> 'was' 1, <i>gotȝ</i> 'goes'
51, &amp;c. In early Norman French <i>z</i> had the sound <i>ts</i>, and so could be
written <i>tz</i>, as in <i>Fitz-Gerald</i> 'son (Mod. Fr. <i>fils</i>) of Gerald'. But
later, French <i>(t)z</i> fell together with <i>s</i> in pronunciation, so that
the spelling <i>tz</i> was transferred to original <i>s</i>, both in
fourteenth-century Anglo-French and in English.</p>

<p><i>qu-</i> occurs for strongly aspirated <i>hw-</i> in <i>quyte</i> 'white' 20, <i>quat</i>
'what' 111; but the alliteration is with <i>w</i>, not with <i>k(w)</i>, e.g.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>And wyth </i>qu<i>ettyng a</i>wh<i>arf, er he </i>w<i>olde lyȝt</i>         152.</p>

</div>

<p>The spelling <i>goud</i> 5, 50, &amp;c., for <i>gōd</i> 'good' may indicate a sound
change.</p>

<p>Notable is the carefully distinguished use of <i>ȝ</i> in <i>ȝe</i>, but <i>y</i>
in <i>yow</i>, e.g. at ll. 23-6.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>3. <i>blessed hym</i>, 'crossed himself'; cp. <span class="smaller">XII</span>  <i>b</i> 86.</p>

<p>4-6. 'He gives a word of praise to the porter,—&lt;who&gt; kneeled before the
prince (i.e. Gawayn) &lt;and who&gt; greeted him with "God and good day," and
"May He save Gawayn!"—and went on his way, attended only by his man,
who, &amp;c.' Clumsiness in turning direct speech into reported speech is a
constant source of difficulty in Middle English. For the suppressed
relative cp. note to <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 36.</p>

<p>11. 'The clouds were high, but it was threatening below them.' <i>Halt</i>
for <i>halet</i> pp. 'drawn up'.</p>

<p>16. 'The way by which they had to go through the wood was very wild.'
Note the regular omission of a verb of motion after <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, &amp;c.
Cp. l. 64 <i>I wyl to þe chapel</i>; l. 332 <i>ȝe schal... to my woneȝ</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>28. 'If you would act according to my wit (i.e. by my advice) you would
fare the better.'</p>

<p>34. <i>Hector, oþer oþer</i>, 'Hector, or any other'. Hector is quoted as the
great hero of the Troy story, from which, and from the legends of
Arthur, the Middle Ages drew their models of valour.</p>

<p>35. 'He brings it about at the green chapel &lt;that&gt;', &amp;c.</p>

<p>37. <i>dyngeȝ</i>: for MS. <i>dynneȝ</i>; Napier's suggestion.</p>

<p>41. 'He would as soon (lit. it seems to him as pleasant to) kill him, as
be alive himself.'</p>

<p>43. 'If you reach that place you will be killed, I may warn you,
knight.' Possibly <i>I</i>, <i>y</i>, has fallen out of the text after <i>y</i> of
<i>may</i> (cp. <span class="smaller">VI</span> 3), though there are clear instances in Old and Middle
English where the pronominal subject must be understood from the
context, e.g. I 168, <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 237, 273. Note the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> transitions from
plural <i>ȝe</i> to singular <i>þe</i> in ll. 42-3; and the evidence at l. 72
f. that <i>þou</i> could still be used in addressing a superior.</p>

<p>44. <i>Trawe ȝe me þat</i>: <i>trow</i> has here a double construction with
both <i>me</i> and <i>þat</i> as direct objects.</p>

<p>56. 'That I shall loyally screen you, and never give out the tale that
you fled for fear of any man that I knew.'</p>

<p>64. <i>for chaunce þat may falle</i>, 'in spite of anything that may happen'.</p>

<p>68-9. 'Though he be a stern lord (lit. a stern man to rule), and armed
with a stave'. The short lines are built more with a view to rime than
to sense.</p>

<p>72-4. 'Marry!' said the other, 'now you say so decidedly that you will
take your own harm upon yourself, and it pleases you to lose your life,
I have no wish to hinder you.'</p>

<p>76. <i>ryde me</i>: an instance of the rare ethic dative, which expresses
some interest in the action of the verb on the part of one who is
neither the doer of the action nor its object. Distinguish the uses
referred to in the notes to <span class="smaller">II</span>  289, <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 24.</p>

<p>86. <i>Lepeȝ hym</i>, 'gallops'. For <i>hym</i>, which refers to the rider, not
the horse, cp. note to <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 24.</p>

<p>92. <i>Gryngolet</i>: the name of Gawayn's horse. <i>gedereȝ þe rake</i> seems
to mean 'takes the path'. No similar transitive use of 'gather' is
known.</p>

<p>95. <i>he wayted hym aboute</i>, 'he looked around him'. Cp. l. 221
<i>wayteȝ</i>, and note to l. 121.</p>

<p>99. 'The clouds seemed to him grazed by the crags'; i.e. the crags were
so high that they seemed to him to scrape the clouds. I owe to Professor
Craigie the suggestion that <i>skayned</i> is ON. <i>skeina</i> 'to graze',
'scratch'.</p>

<p>102-4. 'And soon, a little way off on an open space, a mound (as it
appeared) seemed to him remarkable.'</p>

<p>107. <i>kacheȝ his caple</i>, 'takes control of his horse', i.e. takes up
the reins again to start the horse after the halt mentioned at l. 100.</p>

<p>109. <i>his riche</i>: possibly 'his good steed'. The substantival use of an
adjective is common in alliterative verse, e.g. l. 188 <i>þat schyre</i>
(neck); 200 <i>þe schene</i> (axe); 245 <i>þe scharp</i> (axe); 343 <i>þat cortays</i>
(lady). But it has been suggested that <i>brydel</i> has fallen out of the
text after <i>riche</i>.</p>

<p>114. 'And it was all hollow within, nothing but an old cave.'</p>

<p>115 f. <i>he couþe hit noȝt deme with spelle</i>, 'he could not say &lt;which
it was&gt;'. For <i>deme</i> 'to speak', &amp;c., cp. <span class="smaller">VI</span> 1, <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i> 29-30.</p>

<p>118. <i>Wheþer</i> commonly introduces a direct question and should not be
separately translated. Cp. <span class="smaller">VI</span> 205 and note to <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i> 51.</p>

<p>121. <i>wysty is here</i>, 'it is desolate here'. Note <i>Wowayn</i> = <i>Wauwayn</i>,
an alternative form of <i>Gawayn</i> used for the alliteration. The
alternation is parallel to that in <i>guardian</i>: <i>warden</i>; <i>regard</i>:
<i>reward</i> <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 105; <i>guarantee</i>: <i>warranty</i>; <i>(bi)gyled</i> 359:
<i>(bi)wyled</i> 357; <i>werre</i> 'war' beside French <i>guerre</i>; <i>wait</i> 'watch'
(as at l. 95) beside French <i>guetter</i>; and is due to dialectal
differences in Old French. The Anglo-Norman dialect usually preserved
<i>w</i> in words borrowed from Germanic or Celtic, while others replaced it
by <i>gw</i>, <i>gu</i>, which later became simple <i>g</i> in pronunciation.</p>

<p>125. <i>in my fyue wytteȝ</i>: construe with <i>fele</i>.</p>

<p>127. <i>þat chekke hit bytyde</i>, 'which destruction befall!' <i>þat... hit</i> =
'which'. <i>chekke</i> refers to the checkmate at chess.</p>

<p>135. Had we not Chaucer's Miller and <i>The Reeves Tale</i>, the vividness
and intimacy of the casual allusions would show the place of the
flour-mill in mediaeval life. Havelok drives out his foes</p>

</div>

<p>These are records of hours spent by the village boys amid the noise of
grinding and rush of water, in times when there was no rival mechanism
to share the fascination of the water-driven mill.</p>

<p>137-43. 'This contrivance, as I believe, is prepared, sir knight, for
the honour of meeting me by the way. Let God work His will, Lo! It helps
me not a bit. Though I lose my life, no noise causes me to fear.' It has
been suggested that <i>wel o&lt;r w&gt;oo</i> 'weal or woe' should be read instead
of the interjection <i>we loo!</i> But Gawayn's despair (l. 141) is not in
keeping with ll. 70 f., 90 f., or with the rest of his speech. The
looseness of the short lines makes emendation dangerous. Otherwise we
might read <i>Hit helppeȝ þe not a mote</i>, i.e. whatever happens, mere
noise will not help the Green Knight by making Gawayn afraid; or,
alternatively, <i>hermeȝ</i> 'harms' for <i>helppeȝ</i>.</p>

<p>151. 'Yet he went on with the noise with all speed for a while, and
turned away &lt;to proceed&gt; with his grinding, before he would come
down.' The nonchalance of the Green Knight is marked throughout the
poem.</p>

<p>155. <i>A Deneȝ ax</i>: the ordinary long-bladed battle-axe was called a
'Danish' axe, in French <i>hache danoise</i>, because the Scandinavians in
their raids on England and France first proved its efficiency in battle.</p>

<p>158. <i>bi þat lace</i>, '&lt;measured&gt; by the lace'. In <i>Gawayne</i> (ll. 217 ff.
of the full text) the axe used at the first encounter is described. It
had:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>'A lace wrapped about &lt;the handle&gt;, which was fastened at the &lt;axe's&gt;
head, and was wound about the handle again and again, with many choice
tassels fastened to it', &amp;c.</p>

<p>159. <i>as fyrst</i>, 'as at the first encounter', i.e. when he rode into
Arthur's hall. His outfit of green is minutely described at ll. 151 ff.
of the full text.</p>

<p>162. <i>Sette þe stele to þe stone</i>: i.e. he used the handle of the axe as
a support when crossing rough ground. <i>stele</i> = 'handle', not 'steel'.</p>

<p>164. <i>hypped... strydeȝ</i>: note the frequent alternation of past tense
and historic present. So ll. 3-4 <i>passed... prayses</i>; 107-8
<i>kacheȝ... com... liȝteȝ</i>; 280-1 <i>haldeȝ... gef</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>169 f. 'Now, sweet sir, one can trust you to keep an appointment.'</p>

<p>175. <i>þat þe falled</i>, 'what fell to your lot', i.e. the right to deal
the first blow.</p>

<p>177. <i>oure one</i>, 'by ourselves'. To <i>one</i> 'alone' in early ME. the
dative pronoun was added for emphasis, <i>him one</i>, <i>us one</i>, &amp;c. Later
and more rarely the possessive pronoun is found, as here. <i>Al(l)</i> was
also used to strengthen <i>one</i>; so that there are six possible ME. types:
(1) <i>one</i>, e.g. ll. 6, 50; (2) <i>him one</i>; (3) <i>his one</i>; (4) <i>al one</i> =
<i>alone</i> l. 87; (5) <i>al him one</i>, or <i>him al one</i>; (6) <i>al his one</i>, or
<i>his al one</i>.</p>

<p>181. <i>at a wap one</i>, 'at a single blow'.</p>

<p>183. 'I shall grudge you no good-will because of any harm that befalls
me.'</p>

<p>189-90. 'And acted as if he feared nothing: he would not tremble
(<i>dare</i>) with terror.'</p>

<p>196. 'He (Gawayn) who was ever valiant would have been dead from his
blow there.'</p>

<p>200. It must not be supposed that the chief incidents of <i>Sir Gawayne</i>
were invented by the English poet. The three strokes, for example, two
of them mere feints and the third harmless, can be shown to derive from
the lost French source, which has Irish analogues. See pp. 71-4 of <i>A
Study of Gawain and the Green Knight</i> (London 1916), by Professor
Kittredge, a safe guide in the difficult borderland of folklore and
romance.</p>

<p>207. 'Nor did I raise any quibble in the house of King Arthur.' On
<i>kyngeȝ hous Arthor</i> see note to <span class="smaller">II</span> 518.</p>

<p>222. <i>ryueȝ</i>: the likeness of <i>n</i> and <i>u</i> in MSS. of the time makes
it impossible to say whether the verb is <i>riue</i> 'to cleave', which is
supported by l. 278, or <i>rine</i>, OE. <i>hrīnan</i>, 'to touch'.</p>

<p>230. 'And look out for your neck at this stroke, &lt;to see&gt; if it may
survive.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>233. <i>I hope</i>: here, and often in ME., <i>hope</i> means 'believe', 'expect'.</p>

<p>250. Gawayn appears to have carried his shield on his back. By a
movement of his shoulders he lets it fall in front of him, so that he
can use it in defence.</p>

<p>258. <i>foo</i>, 'fiercely', adv. parallel with <i>ȝederly</i>.</p>

<p>269. <i>ry&lt;n&gt;kande</i>, 'ringing'; Napier's suggestion for MS. <i>rykande</i>.</p>

<p>271-2. 'Nobody here has ill-treated you in an unmannerly way, nor shown
you &lt;discourtesy&gt;': the object of <i>kyd</i> being understood from <i>vnmanerly
mysboden</i>. <i>habbeȝ</i> for MS. <i>habbe</i> is Napier's reading.</p>

<p>278-9. 'And cleft you with no grievous wound, &lt;which&gt; I rightly
&lt;merely&gt; proffered you, because of the compact we made fast', &amp;c. It is
better to assume a suppression of the relative, than to put a strong
stop after <i>rof</i> and treat <i>sore</i> as sb. object of <i>profered</i>. This
latter punctuation gives <i>sore</i> the chief stress in the line, and breaks
the alliteration and rhythm, which is correct as long as <i>sore</i> is taken
with <i>rof</i>, so that its stress is subordinated.</p>

<p>286-7. 'Let a true man truly repay—then one need dread no peril.'</p>

<p>291. <i>weued</i>: perhaps not a weak pa. t. of <i>weave-woven</i>, but rather
means 'to give', from OE. <i>wǣfan</i>, 'to move'; <i>weue</i> in this sense
occurs in <i>Gawayne</i> l. 1976.</p>

<p>294-5. 'And truly you seem to me the most faultless man that ever walked
on foot.' The ME. construction, <i>on þe fautlest</i>, where <i>on</i> 'one'
strengthens the superlative, is found in Chaucer, <i>Clerk's Tale</i> 212:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Thanne was she oon the faireste under sonne,</i></p>
</div>

<p>and still survives in Shakespeare's time, e.g. <i>Henry VIII</i>, II. iv. 48
f. <i>one the wisest prince</i>. It has been compared with Latin <i>unus
maximus</i>, &amp;c. In modern English the apposition has been replaced, with
weakening of the sense: <i>one</i> of <i>the (wisest)</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>298. <i>yow lakked... yow wonted</i>: impersonal, since <i>yow</i> is dative,
'there was lacking in you'.</p>

<p>319. 'Let me win your good-will', 'Pardon me'.</p>

<p>331. I have transposed MS. <b>of</b> <i>þe grene chapel</i> <b>at</b> <i>cheualrous
knyȝteȝ</i>, because such a use of <i>at</i> is hardly conceivable. A
copyist might easily make the slip. Cp. l. 35.</p>

<p>344. <i>Boþe þat on and þat oþer</i>: Besides the Green Knight's young wife,
there was a much older lady in the castle, 'yellow', with 'rugh, ronkled
chekeȝ', and so wrapped up</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>352-6. 'Since these were injured with their wiles, it would be a great
gain to love them well, and not believe them—for a man who could do it
[cp. note to <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 209]. For these (Adam, Solomon, &amp;c.) were of old the
noblest, whom all happiness followed, surpassingly, above all the others
that lived beneath the heavens.' <i>mused</i> 'thought' is used for the rime,
and means no more than 'lived'. ll. 354-6 amount to 'above all other
men'.</p>

<p><b>Dialect</b>: West Midland, like <i>Gawayne</i>.</p>

<p>The metre occasionally gives clear evidence that final flexional <i>-e</i> of

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Þaȝ cortaysly ȝe carp&lt;ė&gt; con</i> <span class="ind2">21.</span></p>
</div>

    <p class="verse1">pp. <i>runne</i> (in rime) 163, beside <i>wroken</i> 15, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>Characteristic Western forms are <i>burne</i> 37 (OE. <i>beorn</i>); <i>vrþe</i> 82
(OE. <i>eorþe</i>).</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p>5. 'Like bubbling water that flows from a spring', i.e. his wild words
rise from a heart that can no longer contain its affliction.</p>

<p>11-12. 'You, who were once the source of all my joy, made sorrow my
companion.'</p>

<p>15. 'From the time when you were removed from every peril'. The child
died before she was two years old (l. 123).</p>

<p>22. 'I am but dust, and rough in manners.' The MS. has <i>marereȝ
mysse</i>, which has been rendered 'botcher's waste'; but the poet is
contrasting his own ill-mannered speech with the Pearl's courtesy.</p>

<p>23. 'But the mercy of Christ and of Mary and of John'. The genitive
inflexion is confined to the noun immediately preceding <i>mersy</i>, while
the two following nouns, which are logically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> genitives with exactly the
same construction as <i>Crystes</i>, remain uninflected. For analogies see
note to <span class="smaller">II</span>  518.</p>

<p>36. <i>and</i>: MS. <i>in</i>. The sign for <i>and</i> is easily mistaken for <i>ī</i> =
<i>in</i>. Cp. note to <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 42.</p>

<p>48. <i>Þat</i>, 'who'.</p>

<p>65. <i>þat... of</i>, 'from whom'; the later relative form <i>of quom</i> occurs
at l. 93.</p>

<p>70. <i>Fenyx of Arraby</i>: the symbol of peerless perfection. Cp. Chaucer,
<i>Death of Blanche the Duchess</i>, ll. 980-3</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Trewly she was to myn ye</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>The soleyn Fenix of Arabye,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>For ther lyveth never but oon,</i></p>
<p class="verse"><i>Ne swich as she ne knew I noon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>71. 'which was faultless in form'; <i>fleȝe</i> 'flew' is used with
weakened sense because a bird is normally thought of as on the wing.</p>

<p>74. <i>folde vp hyr face</i>, '&lt;with&gt; her face upturned'; <i>folde</i> is pp.</p>

<p>91-2. 'And each would wish that the crowns of the others were five times
as precious, if it were possible to better them.'</p>

<p>97. <i>Poule</i>: the common OFr. and ME. form, as at <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 25, 270, <span class="smaller">XI</span>
<i>b</i> 80. But the rime with <i>naule</i> 'nail' (ON. <i>nagl</i>) points to the form
<i>Paule</i> for the original. The reference is to 1 Corinthians vi. 15 and
xii. 12 ff.</p>

<p>100. <i>hys body</i>, 'its body', 'the body'. <i>tyste</i>: for <i>tyȝte</i>
'tight', like l. 102 <i>myste</i> for <i>myȝte</i> 'might'. The rimes with
<i>Kryst</i>, <i>gryste</i>, <i>lyste</i> show that <i>st</i> and <i>ȝt</i> were very similar
in pronunciation. See Appendix § 6 (end).</p>

<p>106. 'Because you wear a ring on arm or finger.'</p>

<p>109-11. 'I &lt;well&gt; believe that there is great courtesy and charity among
you.' The construction of the next line (which conveys an apology, cp.
l. 62) is not clear owing to the following gap in the MS.; nor is it
easy to guess the missing rime word, as <i>emong</i> can rime with OE.
<i>-ung-</i> (e.g. with <i>ȝonge</i>, ll. 114, 175), or with OE. <i>-ang-</i>; see
the note to <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 400.</p>

<p>116. <i>stronge</i> may be adj. 'violent' with <i>worlde</i>, but is more likely
adv. 'severely'.</p>

<p>124-5. Note the cumulation of negatives. <i>cowþeȝ</i> has a double
construction: 'You never knew how to please God nor pray to Him, nor
&lt;did you know even&gt; the Paternoster and Creed.' The Lord's Prayer and
the Apostles' Creed were prescribed by the Church as the elements of
faith to be taught first to a child.</p>

<p>137. Matthew xx. 1-16.</p>

<p>139. 'He represented it very aptly in a parable.'</p>

<p>141. <i>My regne... on hyȝt</i>, 'My kingdom on high'.</p>

<p>145. <i>þys hyne</i>: the labourers. <i>This</i>, <i>these</i> are sometimes used in
early English to refer to persons or things that have not been
previously mentioned, but are prominent in the writer's mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> Cp. <span class="smaller">XV</span>
<i>b</i> 4, 19; and the opening of Chaucer's <i>Prologue</i> to the <i>Franklin's
Tale</i> quoted in the note to <span class="smaller">II</span> 13.</p>

<p>150. <i>pené</i>: in ME. the final sound developed from OFr. <i>-é</i> (<i>e</i>) fell
together with the sounds arising from OE. <i>-ig</i>, OFr. <i>ie</i>, &amp;c. Hence
<i>pené</i> or <i>peny</i> 186 (OE. <i>penig</i>); <i>reprené</i> 184 for <i>repreny</i>;
<i>cortaysé</i> 120, 121, beside <i>cortaysye</i> 72, 84, 96. The acute accent is
editorial.</p>

<p>153. 'At midmorning the master goes to the market.' <i>totȝ</i> (=
<i>tǭs</i>) = <i>tās</i>, contracted form of <i>takes</i> 'betakes himself'; cp.
<i>tone</i> = <i>taken</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 91. The spelling and rimes with <i>o</i> (which cannot
develop normally from <i>ă</i> lengthened in open syllables because this
lengthening is everywhere later than the change <i>ā</i> ≻ <i>ǭ</i>) are
usually explained as artificial. It is assumed that as Northern <i>bān</i>
corresponded to Midland <i>bǭn</i>, so from Northern <i>tá</i> 'take' an
unhistorical Midland <i>tǭ</i> was deduced. But it is possible that the
contraction of <i>tăke(n)</i>, and consequent lengthening <i>tá(n)</i>, is
older than the ordinary lengthening <i>tăke</i> ≻ <i>táke</i>, and also older
than the development of <i>ā</i> to <i>ǭ</i> in North Midland.</p>

<p>164. <i>I yow pay</i>: note the survival of the old use of the present to
express future tense.</p>

<p>176. <i>þat at ȝe moun</i>, 'what you can'. <i>At</i> as a relative appears
usually to be from Old Norse <i>at</i>, with the same sense, and it is not
uncommon in Northern English. But <i>þat at</i> here is more likely the
normal development of <i>þat þat</i> ≻ <i>þat tat</i> (note to <span class="smaller">II</span> 102) ≻ <i>þat at</i>.</p>

<p>179. <i>sumoun</i> is infin. not sb.: 'he had (them) summoned'; cp. note to
<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 79.</p>

<p>192. 'It seems to us we ought to receive more.' <i>Vus þynk</i> is a remnant
of the old impersonal construction of <i>þynceþ</i> 'it seems'. In this
phrase, probably owing to confusion with <i>we þynk(en)</i>, the verb often
has no flexional ending; cp. l. 192. <i>vus oȝe</i> is formed by analogy,
the verb being properly personal; cp. <i>must vs</i> <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 292, 334.</p>

<p>200. <i>And</i>, 'If'.</p>

<p>205-8. <i>More</i>, which is necessary for the metrical form, is best taken
as conj. 'moreover', 'further'; <i>weþer</i> introduces a direct question
(note to <span class="smaller">V</span> 118). <i>louyly</i> is perhaps miswritten for <i>lauly</i> 'lawful', as
the <i>Pearl-Gawayne</i> group often show the converse <i>au</i>, <i>aw</i> for normal
<i>ou</i>, <i>ow</i>, e.g. <i>bawe</i> for <i>bowe</i>, <i>trawþe</i> for <i>trowþe</i>. 'Further, is
my power to do what pleases me with my own lawful?' The meaning is fixed
by Matthew xx. 15 'Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine
own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?'</p>

<p>212. <i>mykeȝ.</i> In the few recorded examples <i>mik</i>, <i>myk</i> seems to mean
'an intimate friend'. Here it is used for the sake of rime in an
extended sense 'chosen companion of the Lord'.</p>

<p>221 f. <i>Wheþer</i>, &amp;c., 'Although I began &lt;only&gt; just now, coming into the
vineyard in the eventide, &lt;yet&gt;', &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>224. Note the rime (OE. <i>sŭm</i>) with ON. <i>blóm(i)</i>, OE. <i>dōm</i>,
<i>cōm</i>. Such rimes occur occasionally in Northern texts of the
fourteenth century—never in the South.</p>

<p>233. Psalm lxii. 12 'Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; for Thou
renderest to every man according to his work.'</p>

<p>237-40. Loosely constructed. 'Now, if you came to payment before him
that stood firm through the long day, then he who did less work would be
more entitled to receive pay, and the further &lt;it is carried&gt;, the less
&lt;work&gt;, the more &lt;claim to be paid&gt;.'</p>

<p>249-51. On the meaning of these lines there is no agreement. Gollancz
and Osgood interpret: 'That man's privilege is great who ever stood in
awe of Him (God) who rescues sinners. From such men no happiness is
withheld, for,' &amp;c. Yet it is difficult to believe that even a poet hard
pressed would use <i>dard to Hym</i> to mean 'feared Him'. One of several
rival interpretations will suffice to show the ambiguities of the text:
'His (God's) generosity, which is always inscrutable (lit. lay hidden),
is abundant to the man who recovers his soul from sin. From such men no
happiness is withheld', &amp;c. The sense and construction of <i>dard</i> (for
which the emendation <i>fard</i>, pret. of <i>fere</i> 'to go', has been
suggested, the rest of the interpretation following Gollancz), and the
obscurity of the argument, are the chief obstacles to a satisfactory
solution.</p>

their deeds, through the writings of men who knew them at first hand
(?) (<i>in dede</i>), &lt;which remained&gt; to be searched by those who followed
after, in order to make known (<i>or</i> to know?) all the manner in which
the events happened, by looking upon letters (i.e. writings) that were
left behind of old'.</p>

<p>45. Benoît de Sainte-Maure says the Athenians rejected Homer's story of
gods fighting like mortals, but charitably explains that, as Homer lived
a hundred years after the siege, it is no wonder if he made mistakes:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>N'est merveille s'il i faillit,</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>Quar onc n'i fu ne rien n'en vit.</i></p>

    <p class="author"><i>Prologue</i>, ll. 55-6.</p>

</div>

<p>53-4. 'That was elegantly compiled by a wise clerk—one Guido, a man who
had searched carefully, and knew all the actions from authors whom he
had by him.' See Introductory note, pp. 68 f.</p>

<p>66-7. Cornelius Nepos was supposed to have found the Greek work of Dares
at Athens when rummaging in an old cupboard (Benoît de Sainte-Maure,
<i>Prologue</i>, ll. 77 ff.).</p>

<p>157. Note the slovenly repetition from l. 151. So l. 159 repeats l. 152.</p>

<p>168-9. I have transposed these lines, assuming that they were misplaced
by a copyist. Guido's Latin favours the change, and the whole passage
will illustrate the English translator's methods:</p>

<p><i>Oyleus uero Aiax qui cum 32 nauibus suis in predictam incidit
tempestatem, omnibus nauibus suis exustis et submersis in mari, in
suis uiribus brachiorum nando semiuiuus peruenit ad terram; et,
inflatus pre nimio potu aque, uix se nudum recepit in littore, vbi
usque ad superuenientis diei lucem quasi mortuus iacuit in arena, [et]
de morte sua sperans potius quam de uita. Sed cum quidam ex suis nando
similiter a maris ingluuie iam erepti nudi peruenissent ad littus,
dominum eorum querunt in littore [et] si forsitan euasisset. Quem in
arena iacentem inueniunt, dulcibus uerborum fouent affatibus, cum nec
in uestibus ipsum nec in alio possunt subsidio refouere.</i> (MS. Harley
4123, fol. 117 a—the bracketed words are superfluous.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>178. <i>Telamon</i> was not at the siege, and his name appears here and in l.
150 as the result of a tangle which begins in the confusion of Oyleus
Ajax with Ajax the son of Telamon. In classical writers after Homer it
is Oyleus Ajax who, at the sack of Troy, drags Cassandra from the temple
of Minerva. This is the story in Dictys. Dares, like Homer, is silent.
In Benoît de Sainte-Maure's poem (ll. 26211-16), the best MSS. name
Oyleus Ajax as Cassandra's captor, but others have '<i>Thelamon Aiax</i>',
i.e. Ajax, the son of Telamon. Guido read Benoît in a MS. of the latter
class, and accordingly makes <i>Telamonius Aiax</i> do the sacrilege. With
the English translator this becomes <i>Telamon</i> simply (Bk. xxix, ll.
11993-7). So when later, in Bk. xxxi, he comes to describe the
shipwreck, he replaces Guido's <i>Aiax</i> by <i>Telamon</i>, and spoils the story
of Minerva's vengeance on the actual violator of her sanctuary.</p>

<p><b>Sounds</b>: OE. <i>y</i> often shows the Western development, as in <i>huyre(d)</i>
108, 133, &amp;c.; <i>abugge</i> 75, 159; beside <i>bigge</i> 275. So <i>Cornehulle</i> <i>b</i>
1. But such forms were not uncommon in the London dialect of the time.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The second extract has a more Southern dialectal colouring. Note
especially the gen. pl. forms <i>lollarene</i> 31, <i>knauene</i> 56, <i>lordene</i>
77, continuing or extending the OE. weak gen. pl. in <i>-ena</i>; and <i>menne</i>
29, 74, retaining the ending of the OE. gen. pl. <i>manna</i>.</p>

<p>The representation of unaccented vowels by <i>u</i> in <i>hure</i> (= 'their') 50,
(= 'her') 53; <i>(h)us</i> 'his' 60, 101; <i>clerkus</i> 65, is commonest in
Western districts. <i>h(w)</i> is no longer aspirated:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> <i>wanne</i> 1, <i>werby</i>
35, MS. <i>eggen</i> 19; and conversely <i>hyf</i> 'if' 43, <i>his</i> 'is' 105.</p>

<hr class="left" />

<p><i>a</i> 9. <i>for shedyng</i>, 'to prevent spilling'; and so <i>for colde</i> 62 'as a
protection against cold'; <i>for bollyng</i> 209 'to prevent swelling'; <i>for
chillyng</i> 306, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 11. <i>Þat ȝe han silke and sendal to sowe</i>: The construction
changes as if Piers had begun: <i>Ich praye ȝow</i>, which is the reading
in the C-text. The difficulty of excluding modern ideas from the
interpretation of the Middle Ages is shown by the comment of a scholar
so accomplished as M. Petit-Dutaillis: 'Il attaque les riches peu
miséricordieux, les <i>dames charmantes aux doigts effilés</i>, qui ne
s'occupent pas des pauvres' (<i>Soulèvement</i>, p. lxii). But there is no
hint of satire or reproach in the text. The poet, always conventional,
assigns to high-born ladies the work which at the time was considered
most fitting for them. So it is reported in praise of the sainted
Isabella of France, sister of St. Louis: <i>Quand elle fust introduicte
des lettres suffisamment, elle s'estudioit à apprendre à ouurer de soye,
et faisoit estolles et autres paremens à saincte Eglise</i>—'When she was
sufficiently introduced to letters, she set herself to learn how to work
in silk, and made stoles and other vestments for Holy Church.'
(Joinville, <i>Histoire d. S. Louys</i>, Paris 1668, pt. i, p. 169.)</p>

<p><i>a</i> 19. <i>for þe Lordes loue of heuene</i>: cp. l. 214, and notes
to <span class="smaller">I</span> 44, <span class="smaller">I</span>
83, <span class="smaller">II</span> 518.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 23. <i>on þe teme</i>, 'on this subject'; <i>teme</i> 'theme' is a correct
form, because Latin <i>th</i> was pronounced <i>t</i>. The modern pronunciation is
due to the influence of classical spelling.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 32. <i>affaite þe</i>, 'tame for thyself'; cp. l. 64 <i>(I shal) brynge
me</i> = 'bring (for myself)', and the note to <span class="smaller">II</span> 289.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 40-1. 'And though you should fine them, let Mercy be the assessor,
and let Meekness rule over you, in spite of Gain.' This is a warning
against abuse of the lord of the manor's power to impose fines in the
manorial court with the object of raising revenue rather than of
administering justice. Cp. Ashley, <i>Introduction to English Economic
History</i>, vol. i (1894), pt. ii, p. 266. For <i>maugré Medes chekes</i> cp.
151.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 49. Luke xiv. 10.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 50. <i>yuel to knowe</i>, 'hard to distinguish'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 72-5. These clumsy lines, which are found in all versions, exemplify
the chief faults in <i>Piers Plowman</i>: structural weakness and superfluous
allegory.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 79. <i>I wil... do wryte my biqueste</i>, 'I will have my will written';
<i>make(n)</i>, <i>ger</i> (<i>gar</i>), and <i>lete(n)</i> are commonly used like <i>do(n)</i>
with an active infinitive, which is most conveniently rendered by the
passive; so <i>do wryte</i> 'cause to be written'; <i>dyd werche</i> 'caused to be
made' <span class="smaller">I</span> 218; <i>mad sumoun</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> 'caused to be summoned' <span class="smaller">VI</span> 179; <i>gert dres

&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 80. <i>In Dei nomine, amen</i>: A regular opening phrase for wills.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 84. 'I trust to have a release from and remission of my debts which
are recorded in that book.' <i>Rental</i>, a book in which the sums due from
a tenant were noted, here means 'record of sins'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 86. <i>he</i>: the parson, as representing the Church.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 91. <i>douȝtres.</i> In l. 73 only one daughter is named. In the
B-text, Passus xviii. 426, she is called <i>Kalote</i> (see note to <i>b</i> 2
below).</p>

<p><i>a</i> 94. <i>bi þe rode of Lukes</i>: at Lucca (French <i>Lucques</i>) is a Crucifix
and a famous representation of the face of Christ, reputed to be the
work of the disciple Nicodemus. From Eadmer and William of Malmesbury we
learn that William the Conqueror's favourite oath was 'By the Face of
Lucca!', and it is worth noting that the frequent and varied adjurations
in Middle English are copied from the French.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 114. 'May the Devil take him who cares!'</p>

<p><i>a</i> 115 ff. <i>faitoures</i> (cp. ll. 185 ff.), who feigned some injury or
disease to avoid work and win the pity of the charitable, multiplied in
the disturbed years following the Black Death. Statutes were passed
against them, and even against those who gave them alms (Jusserand,
<i>English Wayfaring Life</i>, pp. 261 ff.). But the type was long lived. In
the extract from <i>Handlyng Synne</i> (No. I), we have already a monument of
their activities.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 141. 'And those that have cloisters and churches (i.e. monks and
priests) shall have some of my goods to provide themselves with copes.'</p>

<p><i>a</i> 142. <i>Robert Renne-aboute.</i> The type of a wandering preacher;
<i>posteles</i> are clearly preachers with no fixed sphere of authority, like
the mendicant friars and Wiclif's 'poor priests'. Against both the
regular clergy constantly complained that they preached without the
authority of the bishop.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 186. <i>Þat seten</i>: the MS. by confusion has <i>þat seten to seten to
begge</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 187. <i>þat was bake for Bayarde</i>: i.e. 'horse-bread' (l. 208), which
used to be made from beans and peas only. <i>Bayard</i>, properly a 'bay
horse', was, according to romance, the name of the horse given by
Charlemagne to Rinaldo. Hence it became the conventional name for a
horse, just as <i>Reynard</i> was appropriated to the fox. Chaucer speaks of
<i>proude Bayard</i> (<i>Troilus</i>, Bk. i. 218) and, referring to an unknown
story, <i>Bayard the blynde</i> (<i>Canon's Yeoman's Tale</i>, 860).</p>

<p><i>a</i> 221. <i>Michi vindictam</i>: Romans xii. 19.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 224. Luke xvi. 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span><i>a</i> 229. Genesis iii. 19.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 231. <i>Sapience</i>: the Book of Wisdom, but the quotation is actually
from Proverbs xx. 4.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 234. <i>Mathew with mannes face.</i> Each of the evangelists had his
symbol: Matthew, a man; Mark, a lion; Luke, a bull; John, an eagle; and
in early Gospel books their portraits are usually accompanied by the
appropriate symbols.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 235 ff. Matthew xxv. 14 ff.; Luke xix. 12 ff.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 245. <i>Contemplatyf lyf or actyf lyf.</i> The merits of these two ways
of life were endlessly disputed in the Middle Ages. In <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> Wiclif
attacks the position of the monks and of Rolle's followers; and the
author of <i>Pearl</i> (<span class="smaller">VI</span> 61 ff.) takes up the related question of salvation
by works or by grace.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 246. Psalm cxxviii. 1.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 264. Jusserand gives a brief account of the old-time physicians
in <i>English Wayfaring Life</i>, pp. 177 ff. The best were somewhat
haphazard in their methods, and the mountebanks brought
discredit on the profession. Here are a few fourteenth-century
prescriptions:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>For hym that haves the squynansy ['quinsy']</i>:—</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">Tak a fatte katte, and fla hit wele and clene, and draw oute the
guttes; and tak the grees of an urcheon ['hedgehog'], and the
fatte of a bare, and resynes, and feinygreke ['fenugreek'], and
sauge ['sage'], and gumme of wodebynde, and virgyn wax: al this
mye ['grate'] smal, and farse ['stuff'] the catte within als thu
farses a gos: rost hit hale, and geder the grees, and enoynt hym
tharwith. (<i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, ed. Wright and Halliwell (1841),
vol. i, p. 51.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>Ȝyf a woud hund hat ybite a man</i>:—</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">Take tou&lt;n&gt;karsyn ['towncress'], and pulyole ['penny-royal'], and seþ
hit in water, and ȝef hym to drynke, and hit schal caste out þe
venym: and ȝif þou miste ['might'] haue of þe hundys here, ley
hit þerto, and hit schal hele hit. (<i>Medical Works of the
Fourteenth Century</i>, ed. G. Henslow, London 1899, p. 19.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="verse"><i>A goud oynement for þe goute</i>:—</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">Take þe grece of a bor, and þe grece of a ratoun, and cattys
grece, and voxis grece, and hors grece, and þe grece of a brok

hit schal be hol. (Ibid., p. 20.)</p>

<p><i>a</i> 284. <i>Lammasse tyme</i>: August 1, when the new corn (l. 294) would be
in. On this day a loaf was offered as firstfruits: whence the name, OE.
<i>hlāf-mæsse</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 307 ff. Owing to repeated famines, the wages of manual labour rose
throughout the first half of the fourteenth century. A crisis
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> was
reached when the Black Death (1349) so reduced the number of workers
that the survivors were able to demand wages on a scale which seemed
unconscionable to their employers. By the Statute of Labourers (1350 and
1351) an attempt was made to force wages and prices back to the level of
1346. For a day's haymaking 1<i>d.</i> was to be the maximum wage; for
reaping 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> Throughout the second half of the fourteenth
century vain attempts were made to enforce these maxima, and the
penalties did much to fan the unrest that broke out in the Peasants'
Revolt of 1381.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 309-10. From Bk. i of the <i>Disticha</i> of Dionysius Cato, a collection
of proverbs famous throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 321. Saturn was a malevolent planet, as we see from his speech in
Chaucer's <i>Knight's Tale</i>, 1595 ff.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 324. <i>Deth</i>: the Plague.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 1. <i>Cornehulle.</i> Cornhill was one of the liveliest quarters of
fourteenth-century London, and a haunt of idlers, beggars, and doubtful
characters. Its pillory and stocks were famous. Its market where, if
<i>The London Lickpenny</i> is to be credited, dealing in stolen clothes was
a speciality, was privileged above all others in the city. See the
documents in Riley's <i>Memorials of London</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 2. <i>Kytte</i>: In the B-text, Passus xviii. 425-6, <i>Kytte</i> is mentioned
again:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>and riȝt with þat I waked</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>And called Kitte my wyf and Kalote my douȝter.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>b</i> 4. <i>lollares of London</i>: The followers of Wiclif were called
'Lollards' by their opponents; but the word here seems to mean 'idlers'
as in l. 31. <i>lewede heremytes</i>: 'lay hermits': hermits were not
necessarily in holy orders, and so far from seeking complete solitude,
they often lived in the cities or near the great highways, where many
passers would have opportunity to recognize their merit by giving alms.
See Cutts, <i>Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages</i>, pp. 93 ff.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 5. 'For I judged those men as Reason taught me.' Skeat's
interpretation—that <i>made of</i> means 'made verses about'—is forced. The
sense is that the idlers and hermits thought little of the dreamer, and
he was equally critical of them.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 6. <i>as ich cam by Conscience</i>: 'as I passed by Conscience',
referring to a vision described in the previous Passus, in which
Conscience is the principal figure.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 10 f. <i>In hele and in vnité</i>, 'in health and in my full senses', and
<i>Romynge in remembraunce</i> qualify <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 14. <i>Mowe oþer mowen</i>, 'mow or stack'. For these unrelated words see
the Glossary.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 16. <i>haywarde</i>: by derivation 'hedge-ward'. He watched over
enclosures and prevented animals from straying among the crops. Observe
that ME. nouns denoting occupation usually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> survive in surnames:—Baxter
'baker', Bow(y)er, Chapman, Dyer, Falconer, Fletcher 'arrow-maker',
Fo(re)ster, Franklin, Hayward, Lister (= litster, 'dyer'), Palmer,
Reeve(s), Spicer, Sumner, Tyler 'maker or layer of tiles', Warner
'keeper of warrens', Webb, Webster, Wright, Yeoman, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 20-1. 'Or craft of any kind that is necessary to the community, to
provide food for them that are bedridden.'</p>

<p><i>b</i> 24. <i>to long</i>, 'too tall': cp. B-text, Passus xv. 148 <i>my name is
Longe Wille</i>. Consistency in such details in a poem full of
inconsistencies makes it probable that the poet is describing himself,
not an imagined dreamer.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 33. Psalm lxii. 12.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 45. 1 Corinthians vii. 20.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 46 ff. Cp. the note to <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 131 f. The dreamer appears to have
made his living by saying prayers for the souls of the dead, a service
which, from small beginnings in the early Middle Ages, had by this time
withdrawn much of the energy of the clergy from their regular duties.
See note to <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 140 f.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 49. <i>my Seuene Psalmes</i>: the Penitential Psalms, normally vi, xxxii,
xxxviii, li, cii, cxxx, cxliii, in the numbering of the Authorised
Version. The <i>Prymer</i>, which contained the devotions supplementary to
the regular Church service, included the Placebo, Dirige, and the Seven
Psalms: see the edition by Littlehales for the Early English Text
Society.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 50. <i>for hure soules of suche as me helpen</i>: combines the
constructions <i>for þe soules of suche as me helpen</i>, and <i>for hure
soules þat me helpen</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 51. <i>vochen saf</i>: supply <i>me</i> as object, 'warrant me that I shall be
welcome'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 61. 1 Thessalonians v. 15; Leviticus xix. 18.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 63. <i>churches</i>: here and in l. 110 read the Norse form <i>kirkes</i> for
the alliteration, as in <i>a</i> 28, 85. But the English form also belongs to
the original, for it alliterates with <i>ch</i> at <i>a</i> 12, 50.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 64. <i>Dominus</i>, &amp;c.: Psalm xvi. 5.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 83. <i>Symondes sone</i>: a son of Simon Magus—one guilty of simony, or
one who receives preferment merely because of his wealth.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 90. Matthew iv. 4.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 103-4. <i>Simile est</i>, &amp;c.: Matthew xiii. 44. <i>Mulier que</i>, &amp;c.: Luke

<p>75. <i>þe Lapidarye</i>, Latin <i>Lapidarium</i>, was a manual of precious stones,
which contained a good deal of pseudo-scientific information about their
natures and virtues, just as the <i>Bestiary</i> summed up popular knowledge
of animals. A Latin poem by Marbod bishop of Rennes (d. 1123) is the
chief source of the mediaeval lapidaries, and, curiously enough, there
is a French prose text attributed by so intimate an authority as Jean
d'Outremeuse to Mandeville himself. Several Old French texts have been
edited by L. Pannier, <i>Les Lapidaires Français du Moyen Âge</i>, Paris
1882. Their high repute may be judged from the inclusion of no less than
seven copies in the library of Charles V of France (d. 1380); and it is
surprising that no complete ME. version is known. But much of the matter
was absorbed into encyclopaedic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> works like the <i>De Proprietatibus
Rerum</i> of Bartholomaeus, which Trevisa translated.</p>

<p>97. Mistranslated. The French has: <i>qi sont violastre, ou pluis broun qe
violettes</i>.</p>

<p>100-1. <i>But in soth to me</i>: French: <i>Mes endroit de moy</i>, 'but for my
part'; the English translator has rendered <i>en droit</i> separately.</p>

<p>108. <i>þerfore</i>: the context requires the sense 'because', but the
translator would hardly have used <i>þerfore</i> had he realized that ll.
108-9 correspond to a subordinate clause in the French, and do not form
a complete independent sentence. He was misled by the bad punctuation of
some French MSS., e.g. Royal 20 B. <span class="smaller">X</span> and (with consequent corruption)
Harley 4383.</p>

<p>136. <i>Cathaye</i>: China. See the classic work of Colonel Yule, <i>Cathay and
the Way Thither</i>, 2 vols., London 1866. The modernization of the Catalan
map of 1375 in vol. i gives a good idea of Mandeville's geography.</p>

<p>142. <i>withouten wolle</i>: the story of the vegetable lamb is taken from
the Voyage of Friar Odoric, which is accessible in Hakluyt's <i>Voyages</i>.
Hakluyt's translation is reprinted, with the Eastern voyages of John de
Plano Carpini (1246) and of William de Rubruquis (1253), in <i>The Travels
of Sir John Mandeville</i>, ed. A. W. Pollard, London 1900. The legend
probably arose from vague descriptions of the cotton plant; and
Mandeville makes it still more marvellous by describing as without wool
the lamb which had been invented to explain the wool's existence.</p>

<p>143-4. <i>Of þat frute I haue eten</i>: This assertion seems to be due to the
English translator. The normal French text has simply: <i>et cest bien
grant meruaille de ceo fruit, et si est grant oure [= oeuvre] de nature</i>
(MS. Royal 20 B. <span class="smaller">X</span>, f. 70 b).</p>

<p>147. <i>the Bernakes</i>: The barnacle goose—introduced here on a hint from
Odoric—is a species of wild goose that visits the Northern coasts in
winter. It was popularly supposed to grow from the shell-fish called
'barnacle', which attaches itself to floating timber by a stalk
something like the neck and beak of a bird, and has feathery filaments
not unlike plumage. As the breeding place of the barnacle goose was
unknown, and logs with the shell-fish attached were often found on the
coasts, it was supposed that the shell-fish was the fruit of a tree,
which developed in the water into a bird. Giraldus Cambrensis,
<i>Topographia Hibernica</i>, I. xv, reproves certain casuistical members of
the Church who ate the barnacle goose on fast-days on the plea that it
was not flesh; but himself vouches for the marvel. The earliest
reference in English is No. 11 of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Riddles</i>, of which
the best solution is 'barnacle goose'. For a full account see Max
Müller's <i>Lectures on the Science of Language</i>, vol. ii, pp. 583-604.</p>

<p>170. <i>God of Nature</i>: Near the end of the <i>Travels</i> it is explained that
all the Eastern peoples are Deists, though they have not the light of
Christianity: <i>þei beleeven in God þat formede all thing and made the
world, and clepen him 'God of Nature'</i>.</p>

<p>191-2. <i>þat þei schull not gon out on no syde, but be the cost of hire
lond</i>: the general sense requires the omission of <i>but</i>, which has no
equivalent in the original French text: <i>qils ne&lt;nt&gt; issent fors deuers
la coste de sa terre</i> (MS. Sloane 1464, f. 139 b). But some MSS. like
Royal 20 B. <span class="smaller">X</span> have <i>fors qe deuers</i>, a faulty reading that must have
stood in the copy used by the Cotton translator. Cp. note to l. 108.</p>

<p>199-200. <i>a four grete myle</i>: renders the French <i>iiii grantz lieus</i>.
There is no 'great mile' among English measures.</p>

<p>209 ff. In the Middle Ages references to the Jews are nearly always
hostile. They were hated as enemies of the Church, and prejudice was
hardened by stories, like that in the text, of their vengeance to come,
or of ritual murder, like Chaucer's <i>Prioress's Tale</i>. England had its
supposed boy martyrs, William of Norwich (d. 1144), and Hugh of Lincoln
(d. 1255) whom the Prioress invokes:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>O yonge Hugh of Lyncoln, slayn also</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>With cursed Jewes, as it is notable,</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>For it is but a litel while ago,</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>Preye eek for us</i>, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>Religion was not the only cause of bitterness. The Jews, standing
outside the Church and its laws against usury, at a time when financial
needs had outgrown feudal revenues, became the money-lenders and bankers
of Europe; and with a standard rate of interest fixed at over 40 per
cent., debtors and creditors could hardly be friends. In England the
Jews reached the height of their prosperity in the twelfth century, so
that in 1188 nearly half the national contribution for a Crusade came
from them. In the thirteenth century their privileges and operations
were cut down, and they were finally expelled from the country in 1290
(see J. Jacobs, <i>The Jews of Angevin England</i>, 1893). The Lombards,
whose consciences were not nice, took their place as financiers in
fourteenth-century England.</p>

<p>222. <i>trayne</i>: read <i>taynere</i>, OFr. <i>taignere</i> 'a burrow'.</p>

<p>237-8. The cotton plant has already given us the vegetable lamb (l.
142). This more prosaic account is taken from the <i>Eþistola Alexandri ad
Aristotelem</i>: '<i>in Bactriacen... penitus ad abditos Seres, quod genus
hominum foliis arborum decerpendo lanuginem ex silvestri vellere vestes
detexunt</i>' (Julius Valerius,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> ed. B. Kübler, p. 194). From the same text
come the hippopotami, the bitter waters (Kübler, p. 195), and the
griffins (Kübler, p. 217). The <i>Letter of Alexander</i> was translated into
Anglo-Saxon in the tenth century.</p>

<p>254 ff. <i>talouns</i> etc.: In the 1725 edition there is a reference to 'one
4 Foot long in the Cotton Library' with the inscription, <i>Griphi Unguis
Divo Cuthberto Dunelmensi sacer</i>, 'griffin's talon, sacred to St.
Cuthbert of Durham'. This specimen is now in the Mediaeval Department of
the British Museum, and is really the slim, curved horn of an ibex. The
inscription is late (sixteenth century), but the talon was catalogued
among the treasures of Durham in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>260. <i>Prestre Iohn</i>: Old French <i>Prestre Jean</i>, or 'John the Priest',
was reputed to be the Christian ruler of a great kingdom in the East. A
rather minatory letter professing to come from him reached most of the
princes of Europe, and was replied to in all seriousness by Pope
Alexander III. Its claims include the lordship over the tribes of Gog
and Magog whom Alexander the Great walled within the mountains. Official
missions were sent to establish relations with him; but neither in the
Far East nor in Northern Africa, where the best opinion in later times
located his empire, could the great king ever be found. The history of
the legend is set out by Yule in the article <i>Prester John</i> in the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.</p>

<p>261. <i>Yle of Pentexoire</i>: to Mandeville most Eastern countries are
'isles'. <i>Pentexoire</i> in the French text of Odoric is a territory about
the Yellow River (Yule, <i>Cathay</i>, vol. i, p. 146).</p>

<p>274. <i>blamed</i>: The Old French verb <i>empescher</i> means both 'to hinder,
prevent', and 'to accuse, impeach'. But here <i>empeschez</i> should have
been translated by 'prevented', not 'blamed'.</p>

<p>284-306. This passage, which in one form or another appears in nearly
all the MSS. in English, has no equivalent in the MSS. in French so far
examined: and, as it conflicts with ll. 313 ff., which—apart from the
peculiarities of the Cotton rendering—indicate that the <i>Travels</i> were
written after Mandeville's return, it must be set down as an
interpolation.</p>

<p>The art of forging credentials was well understood in the Middle Ages,
and the purpose of this addition was to silence doubters by the
<i>imprimatur</i> of the highest authority, just as the marvel of the Dancers
of Colbek is confirmed by the sponsorship of Pope Leo IX (I 246-9). The
different interpretation of the latest editor, Hamelius, who thinks it
was intended as a sly hit at the Papacy (<i>Quarterly Review</i> for April
1917, pp. 349 f.) seems to rest on the erroneous assumption that the
passage belonged to the French text as originally written.</p>

<p>The anachronism by which the author is made to seek the Pope <i>in Rome</i>
gives a clue to the date of the interpolation. From the beginning of the
fourteenth century until 1377 Avignon, and not Rome, was the seat of the
Pope; and for another thirty years there was doubt as to the issue of
the conflict between the popes, who had their head-quarters at Rome and
were recognized by England, and the antipopes, who remained at Avignon
and had the support of the French. The facts were notorious, so that the
anachronism would hardly be possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> one who wrote much before the
end of the century, even though he were a partisan of the Roman court.</p>

<p>From internal evidence it would seem that the interpolation first
appeared in French. The style is the uniform style of translation, with
the same tags—<i>and ȝee schull vndirstonde</i> = <i>et sachiez</i>; <i>ȝif
it lyke ȝou</i> = <i>si vous plest</i>; and the same trick of double
rendering, e.g. <i>of dyuerse secte and of beleeve</i>; <i>wyse and discreet</i>;
<i>the auctour ne the persone</i>. More decisive is an example of the
syntactical compromise explained in the note to l. 329: <b>be</b> <i>the whiche
the Mappa Mundi was made</i> <b>after</b>. With so many French MSS. of
Mandeville in use in England, an interpolation in French would have more
authority than one that could not be traced beyond English; and it can
hardly be an insuperable objection that no such French text exists
to-day, since our knowledge of the Cotton and Egerton versions
themselves depends in each case on the chance survival of a single MS.</p>

<p>The point has a bearing on the vexed question of the relations of the
English texts one to another. For brevity we may denote by D the
defective text of the early prints and most MSS., which is specially
distinguished by a long gap near the beginning; by C the Cotton text
(ed. Halliwell, Pollard, Hamelius); by E the Egerton text (ed. Warner).
Nicholson (in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>) and Warner give priority
to D, and consider that C and E are independent revisions and expansions
of D by writers who had recourse to the French original. Their argument
seems to be this: There is precise evidence just before the gap that D
derives direct from a mutilated French text (see <i>Enc. Brit.</i>), and if
it be granted that a single translation from the French is the base of
C, D, and E, it follows that C and E are based on D.</p>

<p>A fuller study by Vogels (<i>Handschriftliche Untersuchungen über die
Englische Version Mandeville's</i>, Crefeld 1891) brings to light a new
fact: the two Bodleian MSS., E Museo 116 and Rawlinson D 99, contain an
English translation (say L) made from a Latin text of the <i>Travels</i>.
Vogels also shows that E is based on D, because the characteristic
lacuna of D is filled in E by a passage which is borrowed from L and is
not homogeneous with the rest of E. So far there is no conflict with the
view of Nicholson and Warner. But, after adducing evidence in favour of
the contention that C, D, and E are at base one translation, Vogels
concludes that D derives from C, arguing thus: There is good evidence
that C is a direct translation from the French, and if it be granted
that a single translation from the French is the base of C and D, it
follows that D derives from C.</p>

<p>In short, the one party maintains that C is an expansion of D, the other
that D is an abridgement of C; and this flat opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> results from
the acceptance of common ground: that C and D represent in the main one
translation and not two translations.</p>

<p>To return to our interpolation:</p>

<p>(1) Vogels's first piece of evidence that C, D, and E are at base one
translation is the appearance in all of this interpolation, which is
absent from the MSS. in French. But a passage so remarkable might spread
from one to the other of two independent English texts; or if the
interpolation originated in England in a MS. of the French text since
lost, it might be twice translated.</p>

<p>(2) Vogels assumes that the interpolation first appeared in type C. But
C is the form in which it would be least likely to originate, because
here the contradiction of statement is sharpest owing to the rendering
at ll. 313-14: <i>and now I am comen hom</i>, which is peculiar to C (see the
French).</p>

<p>(3) If, in order to eliminate individual peculiarities, we take two MSS.
of the D type—say Harley 2386 and Royal 17 C. <span class="smaller">XXXVIII</span>—we find that
their text of the interpolation is identical with that of E. This is
consistent with Vogels's finding that the body of E derives from D; and
it confirms the evidence of all the defective MSS. that the
interpolation in this particular form was an integral part of the D
type.</p>

<p>(4) But between the text of the interpolation in D and that in C there
are differences in matter, in sentence order, and in phrasing, which,
while they do not exclude the possibility of interdependence, do not
suggest such a relation. In D the passage is a naked attempt at
authentication; in C it is more artfully though more shamelessly
introduced by the touch of piety conventional in epilogues. And as the
signs of a French original that appear in C are absent from D, it is
unlikely that the text of the interpolation in C derives from D.</p>

<p>(5) Again, in D and E the addition follows the matter of ll. 307-20.
Unfortunately, though the balance of probability is in favour of the
order in C, the order intended by the interpolator is not certain enough
to be made the basis of arguments. But such a difference in position is
naturally explained from the stage when the interpolation stood in the
margin of a MS., or on an inserted slip, so that it might be taken into
the consecutive text at different points. And an examination of the
possibilities will show that if the interpolation originated in French,
the different placing is more simply explained on the assumption that C
and D are independent translations than on the assumption that one of
them derives from the other.</p>

<p>To sum up: the central problem for the history of the English texts is
the relation of C and D. Taken by itself the evidence afforded by the
text of the interpolation is against the derivation of C from D; it
neither favours nor excludes the derivation of D from C; it rather
favours independent translation in C and D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>For the relations of the rest of the text these deductions afford no
more than a clue. Against independent translation of C and D stands the
evidence adduced by Vogels for basic unity. Much of this could be
accounted for by the coincidences that are inevitable in literal prose
translations from a language so near to English in vocabulary and word
order; and a few striking agreements might be due to the use of French
MSS. having abnormal variants in common, or even to reference by a
second translator to the first. The remainder must be weighed against a
considerable body of evidence in the contrary sense, e.g. several places
where the manuscripts of the French text have divergent readings, of
which C translates one, and D another.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that any simple formula will be found to cover the whole
web of relationships: but any way of reconciling the conclusions of the
authorities should be explored; and the first step is an impartial
sifting of all the evidence, with the object of discovering to what
extent C and D are interdependent, and to what extent independent
translations. The chief obstacle is the difficulty of bringing the
necessary texts together; for an investigator who wished to clear the
ground would have to face the labour of preparing a six-text
<i>Mandeville</i>, in the order, French, C, D, E, L, Latin.</p>

<p>301. <i>Mappa Mundi</i>: OFr. and ME. <i>Mappemounde</i>, was the generic name for
a chart of the world, and, by extension, for a descriptive geography of
the world. It is not clear what particular <i>Mappa Mundi</i> is referred to
here, or whether such a map was attached to the manuscript copy of the
<i>Travels</i> in which this interpolation first appeared.</p>

<p>329. <i>fro whom all godenesse and grace cometh fro</i>: cp. 24-5 <i>the lond
of the whiche on of the þre Kynges... was kyng offe</i>; 76-8 <i>þei... of
whom all science... cometh from</i>; and 301-2 <i>be the whiche the</i> Mappa
Mundi <i>was made after</i>. The pleonasm is explained by the divergence of
French and ME. word order. In French, as in modern literary English, the
preposition is placed at the beginning of the clause, before the
relative (<i>de qui</i>, <i>dont</i>, &amp;c.). ME. writers naturally use the relative
<i>that</i>, and postpone the preposition to the end of the clause: e.g. <i>þat
all godenesse cometh fro</i>. The translator compromises between his French
original and his native habit by placing the preposition both at the
beginning and at the end.</p>

<p>Book <span class="smaller">XVII</span> of <i>The Bruce</i> begins with the capture of Berwick by the Scots
in March 1318. Walter Stewart undertakes to hold the city, and is aided
in preparing defences by a Flemish engineer, John Crab. Next year King
Edward II determines to recapture the stronghold by an attack from both
land and sea. He entrenches his forces and makes the first assault
unsuccessfully early in September 1319. In this battle the Scotch
garrison capture a clever engineer (see note to l. 71 below). King
Robert Bruce meanwhile orders a raid into England as a diversion, and on
20 September 1319, an English army, led by the Archbishop of York, is
disastrously defeated by the invaders at Mitton. Our extract gives the
story of the second assault on Berwick, which was also fruitless. The
fortress fell into English hands again as a result of the battle of
Halidon Hill in 1333: see <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>a</i> 35-6.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 12. <i>Wit Sunday</i>: the first element is OE. <i>hwīt</i> 'white', not

<p><i>a</i> 25 ff. Translations of the Bible were common in France at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> this
time. No less than six fine copies survive from the library of John,
Duke of Berry (d. 1416). About the middle of the fourteenth century King
John of France ordered a new translation and commentary to be made at
the expense of the Jews, but it was never finished, although several
scholars were still engaged on it at the end of the century. The early
French verse renderings, which incorporate a good deal of mediaeval
legend, are described by J. Bonnard, <i>Les Traductions de la Bible en
Vers Français au Moyen Âge</i> (Paris 1884); the prose by S. Berger, <i>La
Bible Française au Moyen Âge</i> (Paris 1884). Of the surviving manuscripts
mentioned in these excellent monographs several were written in England.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 28 ff. In earlier times, when most of those who could read at all
were schooled in Latin, the need for English translations of the
Scriptures was not so pressing, and the partial translations that were
made were intended rather for the use of the clergy and their noble
patrons than for the people. Bede (d. 735) completed a rendering of St.
John's Gospel on his death-bed. Old English versions of the Gospels and
the Psalms still survive. Abbot Aelfric (about <small>A.D.</small> 1000) translated the
first five books of the Old Testament; and more than one Middle English
version of the Psalms is known. Wiclif was perhaps unaware of the Old
English precedents because French renderings became fashionable in
England from the twelfth century onwards, and he would probably think of
the Psalter more as a separate service book than as an integral part of
the Bible. But the prologue to the Wiclifite version attributed to John
Purvey quotes the example of Bede and King Alfred; and the Dialogue on
Translation which, in Caxton's print, serves as preface to Trevisa's
translation of Higden, emphasizes the Old English precedents. Both may
be read in <i>Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse</i>, ed. A. W. Pollard,
London 1903, pp. 193 ff. The attitude of the mediaeval Church towards
vernacular translations of the Bible has been studied very fully by Miss
M. Deanesly, <i>The Lollard Bible and other Medieval Biblical Versions</i>,
Cambridge 1920.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 34. <i>þe pley of Ȝork.</i> The York Paternoster Play has not
survived, but there are records from 1389 of a Guild of the Lord's
Prayer at York, whose main object was the production of the play. It
seems to have been an early example of the moral play, holding up 'the
vices to scorn and the virtues to praise', and it probably consisted of
several scenes, each exhibiting one of the Seven Deadly Sins. The last
recorded representation was in 1572. See Chambers, <i>The Mediaeval
Stage</i>, vol. ii, p. 154. The association of the friars with the
production of religious plays is confirmed by other writings of the
time. They were quick to realize the value of dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> representation
as a means of gaining favour with the people, and their encouragement
must be reckoned an important factor in the development of the Miracle
Play.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 126. <i>as Ambrose</i>: In 386 St. Ambrose, besieged in the Portian
Church at Milan by Arian sectaries, kept his followers occupied and in
good heart by introducing the Eastern practice of singing hymns and
antiphons. See St. Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> Bk. ix, c. 7.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 131-2. <i>placebo.</i> Vespers of the Dead, named from the first word of
the antiphon, <i>Placebo Domino in regione vivorum</i> (Psalm cxiv. 9).</p>

<p><i>dirige.</i> Matins of the Dead, named from the first word of the antiphon,
<i>Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam</i> (Psalm v. 9).
Hence our word <i>dirge</i>.</p>

<p><i>comendacion</i>: an office in which the souls of the dead are commended to
God.</p>

<p><i>matynes of Oure Lady</i>: one of the services in honour of the Virgin
introduced in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The whole question of these accretions to the Church services is dealt
with by our English master in liturgical study, the late Mr. Edmund
Bishop, in his essay introductory to the Early English Text Society's
edition of the <i>Prymer</i>, since reprinted with additional notes in his
<i>Liturgica Historica</i> (Oxford 1918), pp. 211 ff.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 137 f. <i>deschaunt, countre note, and orgon, and smale brekynge.</i> The
elaboration of the Church services in mediaeval times was accompanied by
a corresponding enrichment of the music. To the plain chant additional
parts were joined, sung in harmony either above or below the plain
chant. <i>Descant</i> usually means the addition of a part above, <i>organ</i> and
<i>countre-note</i> (= counterpoint) the addition of parts either above or
below. All these could be composed note for note with the plain chant.
But <i>smale brekyng</i> represents a further complication, whereby the
single note in the plain chant was represented by two or more notes in
the accompanying parts.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 140 f. The abuse is referred to in <i>Piers Plowman</i>:</p>

</div>

<p><i>b</i> 183. <i>Ordynalle of Salisbury.</i> An 'ordinal' is a book showing the
order of church services and ceremonies. In mediaeval times there was
considerable divergence in the usage of different churches. But after
the Conquest, and more especially in the thirteenth century, there was
developed at Salisbury Cathedral an elaborate order and form of service
which spread to most of the English churches of any pretensions. This
was called 'Sarum' or 'Salisbury' use.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 209. <i>þei demen it dedly synne a prest to fulfille</i>, &amp;c. For this
construction, cp. Chaucer, <i>Prologue</i> 502 <i>No wonder is a lewed man to
ruste</i>; Shakespeare, <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, V.. iv. 108 f. <i>It is the
lesser blot... Women to change their shapes</i>, &amp;c. The same construction,
where we now insert <i>for</i>, is seen in <i>Gawayne</i> (v. 352-3) <i>hit were a
wynne huge... a leude, þat couþe, to luf hom wel</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 221-3. 'They say that a priest may be excused from saying mass, to
be the substance of which God gave Himself, provided that he hears one.'</p>

<p><i>b</i> 228 f. <i>newe costy portos, antifeners, graielis, and alle oþere
bokis.</i> <i>Portos</i>, French <i>porte hors</i>, represents Latin <i>portiforium</i>, a
breviary convenient for 'carrying out of doors'. The <i>antifener</i>
contained the antiphons, responses, &amp;c., necessary for the musical
service of the canonical hours. The <i>graiel</i>, or <i>gradual</i>, was so
called from the gradual responses, sung at the steps of the altar, or
while the deacon ascended the steps of the pulpit: but the book actually
contained all the choral service of the Mass.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 230. <i>makynge of biblis.</i> Wiclif in his <i>Office of Curates</i> (ed.
Matthew, p. 145) complains of the scarcity of bibles. <i>But fewe curatis
han þe Bible and exposiciouns of þe Gospelis, and litel studien on hem,
and lesse donne after hem. But wolde God þat euery parische chirche in
þis lond hadde a good Bible!</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 234. At this time books, especially illuminated books, were very
dear. The Missal of Westminster Abbey, which is now shown in the
Chapter-house, was written in 1382-4 at a cost of £34 14<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>—a
great sum in those days, for the scribe, Thomas Preston, who took two
years to write it, received only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> £4 for his labour, 20<i>s.</i> for his
livery, and board at the rate of 21<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> the half year. The
inscription in British Museum MS. Royal 19 D. <span class="smaller">II</span>, a magnificently
illustrated Bible with commentary, shows that it was captured at
Poitiers with King John of France, and bought by the Earl of Salisbury
for 100 marks (about £66). Edward III gave the same sum to a nun of
Amesbury for a rich book of romance. In France John, Duke of Berry, paid
as much as £200 for a breviary, and the appraisement of his library in
1416 shows a surprisingly high level of values (L. Delisle, <i>Le Cabinet
des Manuscrits</i>, vol. iii, pp. 171 ff.). These were luxurious books. The
books from the chapel of Archbishop Bowet of York (d. 1423) sold more
reasonably: £8 for a great antiphonar and £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>pro uno libro
vocato 'Bibill'</i>, were the highest prices paid; and from his library
there were some fascinating bargains: 4<i>s.</i> for a small copy of
Gregory's <i>Cura Pastoralis</i>; 5<i>s.</i> <i>pro uno libro vocato 'Johannes
Andrewe', vetere et debili</i>, which would probably turn out to be a dry
work on the Decretals; and 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for a nameless codex, <i>vetere et
caduco</i>, 'old and falling to pieces'. (<i>Historians of the Church of
York</i>, ed. J. Raine, vol. iii, pp. 311, 315.)</p>

<p>But the failing activity of the monastic scriptoria, and the formation
of libraries by the friars and by rich private collectors, made study
difficult for students at the universities, where at this time a
shilling per week—a third of the price of Bowet's most dilapidated
volume—was reckoned enough to cover the expenses of a scholar living
plainly. The college libraries were scantily supplied: books were lent
only in exchange for a valuable pledge; or even pawned, in hard times,
by the colleges themselves.</p>

<p>These conditions were not greatly improved until printing gave an easy
means of duplication, and for a time caused the humble manuscripts in
which most of the mediaeval vernacular literature was preserved to be
treated as waste paper. As late as the eighteenth century Martène found
the superb illuminated manuscripts left by John, Duke of Berry, to the
Sainte Chapelle at Bourges serving as roosting places to their keeper's
hens (<i>Voyage Littéraire</i>, Paris 1717, pt. i, p. 29).</p>

<p><i>b</i> 261-3. The reference is to Acts vi. 2, 'It is not reason that we
should leave the word of God, and serve tables.'</p>

<p><i>b</i> 266. <i>wisere þan.</i> After these words the Corpus MS. (p. 170, col. i,
l. 34 mid.), without any warning, goes on to the closing passage of an
entirely unrelated 'Petition to the King and Parliament'. By way of
compensation, the end of our sermon appears at the close of the
Petition. Clearly the scribe (or some one of his predecessors) copied
without any regard for the sense from a MS. of which the leaves had
become disarranged.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 285. Cp. Acts iii. 6.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b>: The elaborate machinery of sentence connexion deserves special

<hr class="left" />

<p><i>a</i> 1. Gower follows Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Bk. xi. Chaucer tells the
story of Ceix and Alcyone in his <i>Death of Blanche the Duchess</i>, ll. 62
ff. This is presumably the early work to which the Man of Law refers:</p>

    <p class="author">(Link to <i>Man of Law's Tale</i>, ll. 46 ff.)</p>

</div>

<p>Gower's rendering is the more poetical.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 2. <i>Trocinie.</i> Ovid's <i>Trachinia tellus</i>, so called from the city of
Trachis, north-west of Thermopylae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span><i>a</i> 23. <i>As he which wolde go</i>: otiose, or at best meaning no more than
'desiring to go'. Cp. <i>b</i> 25 <i>As he which hadde</i> = 'having' simply; and
similarly <i>b</i> 37, 203. It is an imitation of a contemporary French idiom
<i>comme celui qui</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 26. <i>and</i>: the displacement of the conjunction from its natural
position at the beginning of the clause is characteristic of Gower's
verse. Cp. l. 152 <i>Upon the morwe and up sche sterte</i> = 'and in the
morning she got up', and <i>a</i> 45, 49, <i>b</i> 121, 124, 135, 160, 182. See
notes to ll. 32, 78 f.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 32. Editors put a comma after <i>wepende</i>, and no stop after
<i>seileth</i>: but it is Alceoun who weeps. The displacement of <i>and</i> is
exemplified in the notes to l. 26 and ll. 78 f.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 37. 'One had not to look for grief'; a regular formula of
understatement, meaning 'her grief was great'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 53. <i>Hire reyny cope</i>, &amp;c.: the rainbow, which was the sign or
manifestation of Iris.</p>

</div>


<p>Much of the poetry of Gower's description is due to Ovid.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 78 f. Editors put no stop after <i>may</i> and a comma after <i>hell</i>.
Hence <i>The New English Dictionary</i> quotes this passage as an isolated
instance of <i>noise</i>, transitive, meaning 'disturb with noise'. But
<i>noise</i> is intransitive, <i>hell</i> is governed by <i>aboute round</i>, and the
position of <i>bot</i> is abnormal as in l. 105. Cp. notes to ll. 26, 32, and
render 'But all round about the hill'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 105. For the word order see notes to ll. 26, 32, 78 f.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 117. <i>The lif</i>, 'the man', cp. <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i> 43.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 118. <i>Ithecus</i>: for Icelos. According to Ovid 'Icelos' was the name
by which he was known to the gods, but men called him 'Phobetor'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 123. <i>Panthasas</i>: Ovid's <i>Phantasos</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 152. See note to l. 26.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 197. The halcyon, usually identified with the kingfisher, was
supposed to build a floating nest on the sea in midwinter, and to have
power to calm the winds and waves at that season, bringing 'halcyon
weather'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 2. <i>I finde.</i> Matthew Paris in his <i>Chronica Maiora</i> (ed. Luard,
Rolls Series, vol. ii, pp. 413 ff.) gives a similar story, which, he
says, King Richard the First often told to rebuke ingratitude. In this
version, Vitalis of Venice falls into a pit dug as a trap for wild
beasts. The rescued animals are a lion and a serpent; the rescuer is
nameless, and the gem given to him by the serpent has not the magic
virtue of returning whenever sold. Nearer to Gower is the story told in
Nigel Wireker's <i>Speculum Stultorum</i>, a late twelfth-century satire in
Latin verse, which, from the name of its principal character Burnellus
the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> Ass, who is ambitious to have a longer tail, is sometimes called
<i>Burnellus</i>; cp. Chaucer, <i>Nun's Priest's Tale</i>, l. 492:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p class="verse"><i>I have wel rad in Daun Burnel the Asse</i></p>
  <p class="verse"><i>Among his vers</i>, &amp;c.</p>

</div>


<p>The poem is printed in T. Wright's <i>Anglo-Latin Satirical Poets and
Epigrammatists of the Twelfth Century</i> (Rolls Series, 1872), vol. i. At
the end the Ass returns disappointed to his master Bernardus (= Bardus).
Bernardus, when gathering wood, hears Dryanus (= Adrian), a rich citizen
of Cremona, call from a pit for help. The rescued animals are a lion, a
serpent, and an ape. The gem given by the serpent in token of gratitude
always returns to Bernardus, who, with more honesty than Gower's poor
man shows, takes it back to the buyer. The fame of the marvellous stone
reaches the king; his inquiries bring to light the whole story; and
Dryanus is ordered to give half his goods to Bernardus.</p>

<p>Gower probably worked on a later modification of Nigel's story.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 86. <i>blessed</i>, 'crossed (himself)'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 89. <i>Betwen him and his asse</i>, i.e. pulling together with the ass.
The ass is, of course, the distinguished Burnellus.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 116. <i>his ape</i>: for <i>this ape</i> (?).</p>

<p><i>b</i> 191. <i>Justinian</i>, Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire (d. 565), was
best known for his codification of the Roman Law, and so is named here
as the type of a lawgiver.</p>

<p><b>Sounds</b>: There is no instance of <i>v</i> for initial <i>f</i>, which is
evidenced in the spelling of early South-Western writers like Robert of
Gloucester (about 1300), or of <i>z</i> for initial <i>s</i>, which is less
commonly shown in spelling. <i>u</i> for OE. <i>y</i> occurs in <i>hulles</i> 'hills'
<i>a</i> 18 (beside <i>bysynes</i> <i>b</i> 24, where Modern English has <i>u</i> in
spelling but <i>i</i> in pronunciation; and <i>lift</i> (OE. <i>lyft</i>) <i>b</i> 39, where
Modern English has the South-Eastern form <i>left</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span><i>a</i> 2-3. <i>Mayster... Minerua... hys</i>: Trevisa appears to have understood
'Minerva' as the name of a god.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 6-49. Higden took all this passage from Book i of the
twelfth-century Annals of Alfred of Beverley (ed. Hearne, pp. 6-7). The
<i>Polychronicon</i> is a patchwork of quotations from earlier writers.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 7. <i>Pectoun.</i> Higden has <i>ad Peccum</i>, and Alfred of Beverley <i>in
monte qui vocatur Pec</i>, i.e. The Peak of Derbyshire. <i>cc</i> and <i>ct</i> are
not distinguishable in some hands of the time, and Trevisa has made
<i>Peccum</i> into <i>Pectoun</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 14. <i>Cherdhol.</i> Hearne's text of Alfred of Beverley has <i>Cherole</i>;
Henry of Huntingdon (about 1150), who gives the same four marvels in his
<i>Historia Anglorum</i>, has <i>Chederhole</i>; and on this evidence the place
has been identified with Cheddar in Somerset, where there are famous
caves.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 22. <i>an egle hys nest</i>: cp. <i>b</i> 23 <i>a child hys brouch</i>. This
construction has two origins: (1) It is a periphrasis for the genitive,
especially in the case of masculine and neuter proper names which had no
regular genitive in English; (2) It is an error arising from false
manuscript division of the genitive suffix <i>-es</i>, <i>-is</i>, from its stem.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 36. &lt;<i>þat</i>&gt; here and in l. 52 is inserted on the evidence of the
other MSS. Syntactically its omission is defensible, for the suppressed
relative is a common source of difficulty in Middle English; see the
notes to <span class="smaller">V</span> 4-6, 278-9; <span class="smaller">X</span> 146; <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 54;
<span class="smaller">XVII</span> 66.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 50. <i>Wynburney.</i> Wimborne in Dorset. Here St. Cuthburga founded a
nunnery, which is mentioned in one of Aldhelm's letters as early as <small>A.D.</small>
705. The information that it is 'not far from Bath', which is hardly
accurate, was added by Higden to the account of the marvel he found in
the <i>Topographia Hibernica</i> of Giraldus Cambrensis (vol. v, p. 86 of the
Rolls Series edition of his works).</p>

<p><i>a</i> 54-64. Higden took this passage from Giraldus, <i>Itinerarium
Cambriae</i>, Bk. ii, c. 11 (vol. vi, p. 139 of the Rolls edition).</p>

<p><i>a</i> 60-1. <i>be at here aboue</i>, 'be over them', 'have the upper hand'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 63. <i>Pimbilmere</i>: the English name for Lake Bala.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 6-7. <i>þe Flemmynges.</i> The first settlement of Flemings in
Pembrokeshire took place early in the twelfth century, and in 1154,
Henry II, embarrassed alike by the turbulence of the Welsh, and of the
new host of Flemish mercenaries who had come in under Stephen,
encouraged a further settlement. They formed a colony still
distinguishable from the surrounding Welsh population.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 11-12. The threefold division of the English according to their
Continental origin dates back to Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> History</i>. But
the areas settled by Bede's three tribes do not correspond to Southern,
Northern, and Midland. The Jutes occupied Kent, whence the South-Eastern
dialect; the Saxons occupied the rest of the South, whence the
South-Western dialect; and the Angles settled in the Midlands and the
North; so that the Midland and Northern dialects are both Anglian, and
derive from the same Continental tribe or tribal group.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 26. <i>þe furste moreyn</i>: the Black Death of 1349. There were fresh
outbreaks of plague in 1362, 1369, 1376.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 26-42. The bracketed passage is an addition by Trevisa himself, and
is of primary importance for the history of English and of English
education. See the valuable article by W. H. Stevenson in <i>An English
Miscellany Presented to Dr. Furnivall</i>, pp. 421 ff.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 27-8. <i>Iohan Cornwal, a mayster of gramere.</i> A 'master of grammar'
was a licensed teacher of grammar. Mr. Stevenson points out that in
1347-8 John of Cornwall received payment from Merton College, Oxford,
for teaching the boys of the founder's kin. His countryman Trevisa
probably had personal knowledge of his methods of teaching.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 39-40. <i>and a scholle passe þe se</i>, 'if they should cross the sea'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 47-8. The bracketed words are introduced by Trevisa.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 50 f. <i>and ys gret wondur</i>: <i>and</i> is superfluous and should perhaps
be deleted.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 58-65. Though still often quoted as a fourteenth-century witness to
the pronunciation of Northern English (e.g. by K. Luick, <i>Historische
Grammatik der englischen Sprache</i>, 1914, pp. 40 f.), this passage, as
Higden acknowledges, comes from the Prologue to Book iii of William of
Malmesbury's <i>Gesta Pontificum</i>, completed in the year 1125: see the
Rolls Series edition, p. 209.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 2. <i>Bannokburn.</i> Minot's subject is not so much the defeat of the
English at Bannockburn in 1314, as the English victory at Halidon Hill
on 19 July 1333, which he regards as a vengeance for Bannockburn.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 7. <i>Saint Iohnes toune</i>: Perth, so called from its church of St.
John the Baptist. It was occupied by the English in 1332 after the
defeat of the Scots at Dupplin Moor.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 13. <i>Striflin</i>, 'Stirling'.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 15. Hall suggests that this refers to Scotch raids on the North of
England undertaken to distract Edward III from the siege of Berwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span><i>a</i> 19 f. <i>Rughfute riueling... Berebag</i>: nicknames for the Scots, the
first because they wore brogues (<i>riuelings</i>) of rough hide; the second
because, to allow of greater mobility, each man carried his own bag of
provisions instead of relying on a baggage train.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 22. <i>Brig</i> = <i>Burghes</i> l. 25, 'Bruges'. At this time Scots, English,
and French had all close connexions with the Netherlands. Observe that
John Crab, who aided the Scots in the defence of Berwick (note to <span class="smaller">X</span> 15),
was a Fleming.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 35. <i>at Berwik.</i> Berwick fell as a result of the battle of Halidon
Hill which the Scots fought with the object of raising the siege. For an
earlier siege of Berwick, in 1319, see No. <span class="smaller">X</span>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 36. <i>get</i>, 'watch', 'be on the look out' (ON. <i>gǽta</i>).</p>

<p><i>b</i> 5-6. Calais was at this time a convenient base for piracy in the
Channel.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 19. <i>A bare</i>: Edward III, whom Minot often refers to as
'the boar'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 24-6. In preparation for the long siege Edward III had built a
regular camp beside Calais.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 32. <i>Sir Philip.</i> Philip de Valois, Philip VI of France (1293-1350).
His son, John Duke of Normandy (1319-64), who succeeded him in 1350, is
of good memory as a lover of fine books. Two are mentioned in the notes
to <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i> 25 ff. and <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 234. A splendid copy of the <i>Miracles de
Notre Dame</i>, preserved until recently in the Seminary Library at
Soissons, seems also to have been captured with his baggage at Poitiers,
for it was bought back from the English by King Charles V. Another
famous book produced by his command was the translation of Livy by
Bersuire, with magnificent illuminations. The spirit of the collector
was not damped by his captivity in England from 1356-60, for his account
books show that he continued to employ binders and miniaturists, to
encourage original composition, and to buy books, especially books of
romance. See <i>Notes et Documents relatifs à Jean, Roi de France</i>, &amp;c.,
ed. by Henry of Orleans, Duc d'Aumale (Philobiblon Soc., London 1855-6).</p>

<p><i>b</i> 40. <i>þe Cardinales.</i> Pope Clement VI had sent cardinals Annibale
Ceccano bishop of Frascati, and Etienne Aubert, who became Pope Innocent
VI in 1352, to arrange a peace between France and England. But the
English were suspicious of the Papal court at Avignon, and accused the
cardinals of favouring the French cause.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 82. <i>Sir Iohn de Viene.</i> Jean de Vienne, seigneur de Pagny (d.
1351), a famous captain in the French wars.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 5 f. 'They (friends) are so slippery when put to the test, so
eager to have &lt;for themselves&gt;, and so unwilling to give up &lt;to
others&gt;.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span><i>c</i> 14. <i>And</i>, 'if'.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 47. King John of France was captured at Poitiers in 1356 and held in
England as a prisoner until the Treaty of Bretigny in 1360. See note to
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>b</i> 32.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 54. Note the omission of the relative: 'which recked not a cleat for
all France', and cp. ll. 43-4, <span class="smaller">XIII</span>  <i>a</i> 36 (note).</p>

<p><i>c</i> 59. <i>his helm</i>, 'its helm'—the bar by which the rudder was moved.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 61. 'The King sailed and rowed aright'; on <i>him</i>, see note to <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i>
24.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 83. <i>An ympe</i>: Richard II.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 90. <i>sarri</i>: not in the dictionaries in this sense, is probably OFr.
<i>serré</i>, <i>sarré</i>, in the developed meaning 'active', 'vigorous', seen in
the adv. <i>sarréement</i>.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 103-4. 'If we are disloyal and inactive, so that what is rarely seen
is straightway forgotten.'</p>

<p><i>c</i> 108. 'Who was the fountain of all courage.'</p>

<p><i>c</i> 111. <i>los</i>, 'fame'.</p>

<p><i>d</i> 1. S<span class="smcap lowercase">CHEP</span>: here means 'shepherd', 'pastor', a name taken by Ball as
appropriate to a priest.</p>

<p><i>Seynte Marie prest of Ȝork</i>, 'priest of St. Mary's of York' (cp.
note to <span class="smaller">I</span> 44), a great Benedictine abbey founded soon after the
Conquest; see Dugdale, <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>, vol. iii, pp. 529 ff.
<i>Marie</i> does not take the <i>s</i> inflexion, because it has already the
Latin genitive form, cp. <i>Mary-ȝet</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 163.</p>

<p><i>d</i> 2. <i>Iohan Nameles</i>, 'John Nobody', for <i>nameless</i> has the sense
'obscure', 'lowly'.</p>

<p><i>d</i> 6. <i>Hobbe þe Robbere.</i> <i>Hob</i> is a familiar form for <i>Robert</i>, and it
has been suggested that <i>Hobbe þe Robbere</i> may refer to Robert Hales,
the Treasurer of England, who was executed by the rebels in 1381. But
<i>Robert</i> was a conventional name for a robber, presumably owing to the
similarity of sound. Already in the twelfth century, Mainerus, the
Canterbury scribe of the magnificent Bible now in the library of
Sainte-Geneviève at Paris, plays upon it in an etymological account of
his family: <i>Secundus</i> (sc. <i>frater meus</i>) <i>dicebatur Robertus, quia a
re nomen habuit: spoliator enim diu fuit et praedo</i>. From the fourteenth
century lawless men were called <i>Roberts men</i>. In <i>Piers Plowman</i> Passus
v (A- and B-texts) there is a confession of 'Robert the Robber'; and the
literary fame of the prince of highwaymen, 'Robin Hood', belongs to this
period.</p>

<p><i>d</i> 14. <i>do wel and bettre</i>: note this further evidence of the
popularity of <i>Piers Plowman</i>, with its visions of <i>Dowel</i>, <i>Dobet</i>, and
<i>Dobest</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> 8. <i>Þe clot him clingge!</i> 'May the clay cling to him!' i.e. 'Would
he were dead!'</p>

<p><i>a</i> 12. <i>Þider</i>: MS. <i>Yider</i>, and conversely MS. <i>Þiif</i> 23 for <i>Yiif</i>
'if'. <i>y</i> and <i>þ</i> are endlessly confused by scribes.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 1. <i>Lenten ys come... to toune.</i> In the Old English <i>Metrical
Calendar</i> phrases like <i>cymeð... us to tune Martius reðe</i>, 'fierce March
comes to town', are regular. The meaning is 'to the dwellings of men',
'to the world'.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 3. <i>Þat</i>: construe with <i>Lenten</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 7. <i>him þreteþ</i>, 'chides', 'wrangles' (ON. <i>þrǽta</i>?). See the
thirteenth-century debate of <i>The Thrush and the Nightingale</i>
(<i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, vol. i, pp. 241 ff.), of which the opening lines
are closely related to this poem.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 11. <i>Ant wlyteþ on huere wynter wele</i>, 'and look at their winter
happiness (?)'. This conflicts with <i>huere wynter wo</i> above; and the
explanation that the birds have forgotten the hardships of the past
winter and recall only its pleasures is forced. Holthausen's emendation
<i>wynne wele</i> 'wealth of joys' (cp. l. 35) is good.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 20. <i>Miles</i>: a crux. It has been suggested without much probability
that <i>miles</i> means 'animals' from Welsh <i>mīl</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> 28. <i>Deawes donkeþ þe dounes.</i> Of the suggestions made to improve
the halting metre the best is <i>þise</i> for <i>þe</i>. The poet is thinking of
the sparkle of dew in the morning sun; cp. <i>Sir Gawayne</i> 519 f.:</p>


<div class="poem">
    <p class="verse"><i>When þe donkande dewe dropeȝ of þe leueȝ</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>To bide a blysful blusch of þe bryȝt sunne.</i></p>
</div>


<p><i>b</i> 29-30. 'Animals with their cries (<i>rounes</i>) unmeaning to us
(<i>derne</i>), whereby they converse (<i>domes for te deme</i>).' For the
weakened sense of <i>deme</i> (<i>domes</i>) see note to <span class="smaller">V</span> 115.</p>

<p><i>c</i> 30. <i>Wery so water in wore</i>: the restless lover (l. 21) has tossed
all night like the troubled waters in a <i>wore</i>; cp. <i>I wake so water in
wore</i> in another lyric of the same MS. It has been suggested that <i>wore</i>
= Old High German <i>wuor</i> 'weir'; but the rimes in both passages show
that the stem is OE. <i>wār</i>, not <i>wōr</i>.</p>

<p><i>d</i> 2. <i>the holy londe</i>: because Ireland was <i>par excellence</i> 'the Land
of the Saints'.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> I am obliged to Professor Carleton Brown for the information that
this poem is found, with two additional stanzas, in MS. 18. 7. 21 of the
Advocates' Library, Edinburgh; and that the full text will be published
shortly in his <i>Religious Lyrics of the Fourteenth Century</i>.</p>

<p><i>f</i> 4. <i>bere</i> (OE. <i>bȳr</i>) riming with <i>fere</i> (OE. <i>(ge)fēra</i>)
indicates a South-Eastern composition.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 1. <i>Scere Þorsday</i>: Maundy Thursday, the eve of Good Friday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><i>g</i> 1-2. <i>aros</i>: <i>Iudas</i>: the alternative form <i>aras</i> may have given the
rime in the original, but it is not justifiable to accept this as
certain and so to assume an early date of composition for the poem.
Morsbach, <i>ME. Grammatik</i>, § 135, n. 4, quotes a number of parallel
rimes with proper names, and the best explanation is that <i>o</i> in <i>aros</i>
still represented a sound intermediate between <i>ā</i> and <i>ǭ</i>, and
so served as an approximate rime to <i>ā̆</i> in proper names.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 6. <i>cunesmen</i>: as <i>c</i> and <i>t</i> are hard to distinguish in some ME.
hands, and are often confused by copyists, this reading is more likely
than <i>tunesmen</i> of the editors—Wright-Halliwell, Mätzner, Child, Cook
(and <i>N. E. D.</i> s.v. <i>townsman</i>). For (1) <i>tunesman</i> is a technical, not
a poetical word. (2) In a poem remarkable for its terseness, <i>tunesmen</i>
reduces a whole line to inanity, unless the poet thinks of Judas quite
precisely as a citizen of a town other than Jerusalem; and in the
absence of any Biblical tradition it is unlikely that a writer who calls
Pilate <i>þe riche Ieu</i> would gratuitously assume that Judas was not a
citizen of Jerusalem, where his sister lived. (3) Christ's words are
throughout vaguely prophetic, and as Judas forthwith <i>imette wid is
soster</i>—one of his kin—<i>cunesmen</i> gives a pregnant sense. [I find the
MS. actually has <i>cunesmen</i>, but leave the note, lest <i>tunesmen</i> might
appear to be better established.]</p>

<p><i>g</i> 8. The repetition of ll. 8, 25, 30 is indicated in the MS. by 'ii'
at the end of each of these lines, which is the regular sign for <i>bis</i>.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 16. 'He tore his hair until it was bathed in blood.' The MS. has
<i>top</i>, not <i>cop</i>.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 24. <i>In him com ur Lord gon.</i> In the MS. <i>c'ist</i> = <i>Crist</i> has been
erased after <i>Lord</i>. Note (1) the reflexive use of <i>him</i>, which is very
common in OE. and ME. with verbs of motion, e.g. <i>Up him stod</i> 27, 29;
<i>Þau Pilatus him com</i> 30; <i>Als I me rode</i> <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>a</i> 4; <i>The Kyng him rod</i>
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 61; cp. the extended use <i>ar þe coc him crowe</i> 33, and notes to
<span class="smaller">II</span> 289, <span class="smaller">V</span> 86: (2) the use of the infinitive (<i>gon</i>) following, and
usually defining the sense of, a verb of motion, where Modern English
always, and ME. commonly (e.g. <i>ȝede karoland</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 117; <i>com daunceing</i>
<span class="smaller">II</span> 298), uses the pres. p.: 'Our Lord came walking in'.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 27. <i>am I þat?</i> 'Is it I?', the interrogative form of <i>ich hit am</i>
or <i>ich am hit</i>. The editors who have proposed to complete the line by
adding <i>wrech</i>, have missed the sense. The original rime was <i>þet</i>:
<i>spec</i>, cp. note to <span class="smaller">I</span> 240.</p>

<p><i>g</i> 30. <i>cnistes</i>: for <i>cniste</i> = <i>cnihte</i> representing the OE. gen. pl.
<i>cnihta</i>. On the forms <i>meist</i> 6, <i>heiste</i> 18, <i>eiste</i> 20, <i>bitaiste</i>
21, <i>iboust</i> 26, <i>miste</i> 29, <i>cnistes</i> 30, <i>fiste</i> 31, all with <i>st</i> for
OE. <i>ht</i>, see Appendix § 6 end.</p>

<p><i>h</i> 17-18. Difficult. Perhaps 'The master smith lengthens
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> a little
piece [sc. of hot iron], and hammers a smaller piece, twines the two
together, and strikes [with his hammer] a treble note'.</p>

<p><i>h</i> 21-2. <i>cloþemerys... brenwaterys</i>: not in the dictionaries, but both
apparently nonce names for the smiths: they 'clothe horses' (for by the
end of the fourteenth century a charger carried a good deal of armour
and harness), and 'burn water' (when they temper the red-hot metal).</p>

<p><i>i</i> 4. <i>Þat</i>: dat. rel. 'to whom'; cp. <span class="smaller">VI</span> 64. But <i>lowte</i> is sometimes
transitive 'to reverence'.</p>

<p><i>i</i> 6. This line, at first sight irrelevant, supplies both rime and
doctrine. See in Chaucer's Preface to his <i>Tale of Melibeus</i> the passage
ending:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>I meene of Marke, Mathew, Luc and John</i>—</p>
    <p class="verse"><i>Bot doutelees hir sentence is all oon.</i></p>

</div>

<p>An erased <i>t</i> after <i>Awangelys</i> in the MS. shows that the scribe wavered
between <i>Awangelys</i> 'Gospels' and <i>Awangelystes</i>.</p>

<p><i>i</i> 7. <i>Sent Geretrude</i>: Abbess of Nivelle (d. 659), commemorated on
March 17. She is appropriately invoked, for one or more rats make her
emblem.</p>

<p><i>i</i> 11. <i>Sent Kasi.</i> I cannot trace this saint, or his acts against the
rats. But parallels are not wanting. St. Ivor, an Irish saint, banished
rats from his neighbourhood <i>per imprecationem</i> because they gnawed his
books; and the charm-harassed life of an Irish rat was still proverbial
in Shakespeare's day: 'I was never so berhymed' says Rosalind (<i>As You
Like It</i>, III. ii) 'since Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat'. In
the South of France the citizens of Autun trusted more to the processes
of the law, and brought a suit against the rats which ended in a victory
for the defendants because the plaintiffs were unable to guarantee them
safe conduct to the court (see Chambers, <i>Book of Days</i>, under Jan. 17).
Even in such little things the Normans showed their practical genius:—A
friend chancing to meet St. Lanfranc by the way inquired the cause of
the strange noises that came from a bag he was carrying: 'We are
terribly plagued with mice and rats', explained the good man, 'and so,
to put down their ravages, I am bringing along a cat' (<i>Mures et rati
valde nobis sunt infesti, et idcirco nunc affero catum ad comprimendum
furorem illorum</i>). <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> for May 28, p. 824.</p>

calculation the writer changes 5,500, which is the figure in the Greek
and Latin texts of the Gospel of Nicodemus, in the French verse
renderings, and the ME. poem <i>Harrowing of Hell</i>. Cp. l. 354.</p>

<p>40. <i>in þis stedde</i>: the rimes <i>hadde</i>: <i>gladde</i>: <i>sadde</i> point to the
Towneley MS. reading <i>in darknes stad</i>, 'set in darkness', as nearer the
original, which possibly had <i>in þister(nes) stad</i>.</p>

<p>49. <i>we</i>: read <i>ȝe</i> (?). For what follows cp. Isaiah ix. 1-2.</p>

<p>59. <i>puplisshid</i>: the rime with <i>Criste</i> shows that the pronunciation
was <i>puplist</i>. Similarly, <i>abasshed</i>: <i>traste</i> 177-9. In French these
words have <i>-ss-</i>, which normally becomes <i>-sh-</i> in English. It is hard
to say whether <i>-ss-</i> remained throughout in Northern dialects, or
whether the development was OFr. <i>-ss-</i> ≻ ME. <i>-sh-</i> ≻ Northern <i>-ss-</i>
(notes to <span class="smaller">I</span> 128, <span class="smaller">VII</span> 4).</p>

<p>62. <i>þis</i>: read <i>His (?) frendis</i>: here 'relatives', 'parents' (ON.
<i>frǽndi</i>); see Luke ii. 27.</p>

<p>65-8. Luke ii. 29-32.</p>

<p>73-82. Matthew iii. 13-17, &amp;c.</p>

<p>75. <i>hande</i>: the rime requires the Norse plural <i>hend</i> as at l. 400; cp.
<span class="smaller">XVII</span> 255, <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i> 65 (Footnote).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>86 ff. Cp. Matthew xvii. 3 ff., Mark ix. 2 ff.</p>

<p>113. <i>Astrotte</i>: cp. 2 Kings xxiii. 13 'Ashtoreth, the abomination of
the Zidonians'. I cannot identify <i>Anaball</i> among the false gods.</p>

<p>115. <i>Bele-Berit</i>: Judges viii. 33 'the children of Israel... made
Baal-Berith their god'. For <i>Belial</i> see 2 Cor. vi. 15.</p>

<p>122-4. A common misrendering for 'Be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors',
Psalm xxiv. 7.</p>

<p>125 ff. postulate a preceding <i>et introibit rex glorię</i>, which the
writer has not been able to work into the frame of his verse.</p>

<p>128. <i>a kyng of vertues clere</i> = <i>dominus virtutum</i>, rendered 'Lord of
Hosts' in Psalm xxiv. 10.</p>

<p>154-6. <i>ware</i>: <i>ferre</i>: the rime indicates some corruption. <i>ware</i>
probably stands for <i>werre</i> 'worse'. The Towneley MS. has <i>or it be
war</i>.</p>

<p>162. John xi.</p>

<p>165. John xiii. 27.</p>

<p>171 ff. 'And know he won away Lazarus, who was given to us to take
charge of, do you think that you can hinder him from showing the powers
that he has purposed (to show)?' But it is doubtful whether <i>what</i> is a
true relative. Rather 'from showing his powers—those he has purposed
(to show)'.</p>

<p>188. <i>I prophicied</i>: MS. <i>of prophicie</i> breaks the rime scheme.</p>

<p>190. Psalm cvii. 16 'For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the
bars of iron in sunder.'</p>

<p>205 ff. The rimes <i>saide</i>: <i>braide</i>: <i>ferde</i>: <i>grathed</i> are bad. For the
last two read <i>flaide</i> = 'terrified', and <i>graid</i>, a shortened form of
<i>graithed</i>.</p>

<p>208. <i>and we wer moo</i>, 'if we were more', 'even if there were more of
us'.</p>

<p>220. <i>as my prisoune</i> might be taken closely with <i>here</i>: 'in this place
as my prison'. The Towneley MS. has <i>in</i> for <i>as</i>. Better would be
<i>prisoune&lt;s&gt;</i> 'prisoners'.</p>

<p>240. <i>wolle</i>: read <i>wille</i> for the rime.</p>

<p>241. <i>God&lt;ys&gt; sonne</i>: MS. <i>God sonne</i> might be defended as parallel to
the instances in the note to <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 88.</p>

<p>256. Apparently, 'you argue his men in the mire', i.e. if Jesus is God's
Son, the souls should remain in hell because God put them there. But the
text may be corrupt.</p>

<p>267 ff. Cp. Ezekiel xxxi. 16, &amp;c.</p>

<p>281 ff. <i>Salamon saide</i>: Proverbs ii. 18-19 taken with vii. 27 and ix.
18. It was hotly disputed in the Middle Ages whether Solomon himself was
still in hell. Dante, <i>Paradiso</i>, x. 110, informs a world eager for
tidings that he is in Paradise: but Langland declares <i>Ich leyue he be
in helle</i> (C-text, iv. 330); and, more sweepingly, coupling him with
Aristotle: <i>Al holy chirche holden hem in helle</i> (A-text, xi. 263).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>285-8. Perhaps a gloss on Job xxxvi. 18 'Because there is wrath, beware
lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot
deliver thee.'</p>

<p>301. <i>menys</i>, the reading of the Towneley MS. is better than <i>mouys</i>,
which appears to be a copyist's error due to the similarity of <i>n</i> and
<i>u</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>, in the handwriting of the time.</p>

<p>308. Judas hanged himself, according to Matthew xxvii. 3-5; Acts i. 18
gives a different account of his end. <i>Archedefell</i>: Ahithophel who
hanged himself (2 Samuel xvii. 23) after the failure of his plot against
David.</p>

<p>309. <i>Datan and Abiron</i>: see Numbers xvi.</p>

<p>313-16. 'And all who do not care to learn my law (which I have left in
the land newly, and which is to make known my Coming), and to go to my
Sacrament, and those who will not believe in my Death and my
Resurrection read in order—they are not true.'</p>

<p>338. <i>þou bus</i>, 'you ought'; <i>bus</i>, a Northern contracted form of
<i>behoves</i>, is here used as a personal verb, where <i>þe bus</i>, 'it behoves
thee', is normal. See note to <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 196.</p>

<p>360. <i>moste</i>: read <i>maste</i> to rime with <i>taste</i>.</p>

<p>371. <i>Of þis comyng</i>: the Towneley MS. reading <i>of Thi commyng</i> is
possible.</p>

<p>378-80: Corrupt. The copy from which the extant MS. was made seems to
have been indistinct here. The Towneley MS. has:</p>


<div class="poem">

    <p class="verse"><i>Suffre thou neuer Thi sayntys to se</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>The sorow of thaym that won in wo,</i></p>
    <p class="verse"><i>Ay full of fylth, and may not fle</i>,</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">which is more intelligible and nearer Psalm xvi. 10:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>Nec dabis sanctum tuum videre corruptionem.</i></p>

<p>10. <i>is</i>: read <i>es</i> for the rime. Cp. note to <span class="smaller">I</span> 128-9.</p>

<p>42. <i>and sythen</i>: MS. <i>in sythen</i>. Cp. note to <span class="smaller">VI</span> 36.</p>

<p>49. <i>syn</i>: 3 pl. because <i>euery liffyng leyde</i> is equivalent to a plural
subject 'all men'.</p>

<p>52. <i>coueteis</i>: MS. <i>couetous</i>.</p>

<p>56. <i>alod</i>: a shortened form of <i>allowed</i>, apparently on the analogy of
such words as <i>lead</i> infin., <i>led</i> pa. t. and pp. For a parallel see
note to <span class="smaller">I</span> 254-5.</p>

<p>57. <i>Sex hundreth yeris and od</i>: the <i>od</i> thrown in to rime, as Noah was
exactly 600 years old according to Genesis vii. 6.</p>

<p>66. <i>and my fry shal with me fall</i>: 'and the children &lt;that&gt; I may have'
(?).</p>

<p>88. <i>for syn sake</i>: 'because of sin'. Until modern times a genitive
preceding <i>sake</i> usually has no <i>s</i>, e.g. <i>for goodness sake</i>. The
genitive of <i>sin</i> historically had no <i>s</i> (OE. <i>synne</i>), but the
omission in a Northern text is due rather to euphony than to survival of
an old genitive form. Cp. <i>for tempest sake</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 177.</p>

<p>108. <i>then</i>: 'nor', a rare Northern usage, which is treated as an error
here in England and Pollard's text, though it occurs again at l. 535.
Conversely <i>nor</i> is used dialectally for <i>than</i>.</p>

<p>109. <i>Hym to mekill wyn</i>: 'to his great happiness'.</p>

<p>137. <i>take</i>: 'make', and so in l. 272.</p>

<p>167-71. <i>knowe</i>: <i>awe</i>. The rime requires <i>knāwe</i> or <i>ǭwe</i>.</p>

<p>191. 'The worse &lt;because&gt; I see thee.'</p>

<p>196. <i>what thou thynk</i>: 'what seems to you best', 'what you like'; <i>thou
thynk</i> for <i>thee thynk</i>—the verb being properly impersonal; see notes
to <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 338 and <span class="smaller">VI</span> 192.</p>

<p>200. <i>Stafford blew</i>: from the context this line might mean 'you are a
scaremonger', for blue is the recognized colour of fear, and it might be
supposed that 'Stafford blue' represents a material like 'Lincoln
green'. But Mätzner is certainly right in interpreting the line 'you
deserve a beating'. <i>Stafford blew</i> would then be the livid colour
produced by blows. The reference, unless there is a play on <i>staff</i>, is
obscure.</p>

<p>202. <i>led</i>: 'treated'.</p>

<p>211. <i>sory</i>: the rime requires <i>sary</i>.</p>

<p>220. <i>Mary</i>: the later <i>marry!</i> = 'by (the Virgin) Mary!' cp. l. 226. So
<i>Peter!</i> 367 = 'by St. Peter!'</p>

<p>246. <i>to knaw</i>: 'to confess'.</p>

<p>247-8. <i>daw to ken</i>: 'to be recognized as stupid', 'a manifest fool'.</p>

<p>272. <i>castell</i>: note the rime with <i>sayll</i>: <i>nayll</i>: <i>fayll</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> may
be due to suffix substitution on the analogy of <i>catail</i> beside <i>catel</i>
'cattle'. For <i>take</i> see note to 137.</p>

<p>281. <i>chambre</i>: the rime points to a by-form <i>chamb(o)ur</i>, but the
uninflected form is awkward. Cp. <i>thre chese chambres</i> 'three tiers of
chambers' 129, where the construction is the same as the obsolete <i>three
pair gloves</i>.</p>

<p>289-92. Read <i>lider</i>, <i>hider</i>, <i>togider</i>.</p>

<p>292. <i>must vs</i>: cp. l. 334 and note to <span class="smaller">VI</span> 192.</p>

<p>298. 'There is other yarn on the reel', i.e. there is other business on
hand.</p>

<p>320. <i>brether sam</i>: 'brothers both'. Some editors prefer to read
<i>brother Sam</i> 'brother Shem'.</p>

<p>336 ff. Chaucer refers to the quarrels of Noah and his wife in the
<i>Miller's Tale</i> (ll. 352 ff.):—</p>


<div class="poem">

<p class="verse"><i>'Hastou nat herd', quod Nicholas, 'also</i></p>

<p class="verse"><i>That she hadde had a shipe hirself allone.'</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The tradition is old. In the splendid tenth-century Bodleian MS. Junius
11, which contains the so-called Caedmon poems, a picture of the Ark
shows Noah's wife standing at the foot of the gangway, and one of her
sons trying to persuade her to come in.</p>

<p>370. <i>Yei</i> is defensible; cp. l. 353. <i>Þe</i> 'the' has been suggested.</p>

<p>383. <i>Wat Wynk</i>: an alliterative nick-name like <i>Nicholl Nedy</i> in l.
405.</p>

<p>400. <i>emong</i>: OE. <i>gemang</i>, here rimes as in Modern English with <i>u</i>
(OE. <i>iung</i>: <i>tunge</i>: <i>lungen</i>), cp. note to <span class="smaller">VI</span> 109 ff.; but in ll.
244-7 it rimes with <i>lang</i>: <i>fang</i>: <i>gang</i>—all with original <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>417. &lt;<i>floodis</i>&gt;. Some such word is missing in the MS. Cp. ll. 454 f.
and 426.</p>

<p>461. <i>How</i>: MS. <i>Now</i>. The correction is due to Professor Child. Initial
capitals are peculiarly liable to be miscopied.</p>

<p>463. <i>grufe</i>: a Northern and Scottish form of the verb <i>grow</i>. The sb.
<i>ro</i> 'rest' 237 sometimes has a parallel form <i>rufe</i>.</p>

<p>525. <i>stold</i>: for <i>stalled</i> 'fixed'. Note the rime words, which all have
alternative forms <i>behald</i>: <i>bald</i>: <i>wald</i>.</p>









<h2>
<span class="larger"><a id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</span>
<span>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY</span>
</h2>


<p>§ 1. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ENERAL</span>. Gower's work shows that at the end of the century Latin
and French still shared with English the place of a literary language. But their hold was precarious.</p>

<p>Latin was steadily losing ground. The Wiclifite translation of the Bible
threatened its hitherto unchallenged position as the language of the
Church; and the Renaissance had not yet come to give it a new life among
secular scholars.</p>

<p>French was still spoken at the court; but in 1387 Trevisa remarks (p.
149) that it was no longer considered an essential part of a gentleman's
education: and he records a significant reform—the replacement of
French by English as the medium of teaching in schools. After the end of
the century Anglo-French, the native development of Norman, was
practically confined to legal use, and French of Paris was the accepted
standard French.</p>

<p>English gained wherever Latin and French lost ground. But though the
work of Chaucer, Gower, and Wiclif foreshadows the coming supremacy of
the East Midland, or, more particularly, the London dialect, there was
as yet no recognized standard of literary English. The spoken language
showed a multiplicity of local varieties, and a writer adopted the
particular variety that was most familiar to him. Hence it is almost
true to say that every considerable text requires a special grammar.</p>

<p>Confusion is increased by the scribes. Nowadays a book is issued in
hundreds or thousands of uniform copies, and within a few months of
publication it may be read in any part of the world. In the fourteenth
century a book was made known to readers only by the slow and costly
multiplication of manuscripts. The copyist might work long after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> the
date of composition, and he would then be likely to modernize the
language, which in its written form was not stable as it is at present:
so of Barbour's <i>Bruce</i> the oldest extant copies were made nearly a
century after Barbour's death. Again, if the dialect of the author were
unfamiliar to the copyist, he might substitute familiar words and forms.
Defective rimes often bear witness to these substitutions.</p>

<p>Nor have we to reckon only with copyists, who are as a rule careless
rather than bold innovators. While books were scarce and many could not
read them, professional minstrels and amateur reciters played a great
part in the transmission of popular literature; and they, whether from
defective memory or from belief in their own talents, treated the exact
form and words of their author with scant respect. An extreme instance
is given by the MSS. of <i>Sir Orfeo</i> at ll. 267-8:</p>

<table summary="MSS. of Sir Orfeo at ll. 267-8">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Auchinleck MS.: </td>
<td class="tdl"><i>His harp, whereon was al his gle,</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>He hidde in an holwe tre;</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl1">Harley MS.:    </td>
<td class="tdl1"> <i>He takeþ his harpe and makeþ hym gle,</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>And lyþe al nyȝt vnder a tre;</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl1">Ashmole MS.:  </td>
<td class="tdl1"> <i>In a tre þat was holow</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>Þer was hys haule euyn and morow.</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If the Ashmole MS. alone had survived we should have no hint of the
degree of corruption.</p>

<p>And so, before the extant MSS. recorded the text, copyists and reciters
may have added change to change, jumbling the speech of different men,
generations, and places, and producing those 'mixed' texts which are the
will-o'-the-wisps of language study.</p>

<p>Faced with these perplexities, beginners might well echo the words of
Langland's pilgrims in search of Truth:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p class="verse"><i>This were a wikked way, but whoso hadde a gyde</i></p>
   <p class="verse indent2"><i>That wolde folwen vs eche a fote.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There is no such complete guide, for the first part of Morsbach's
<i>Mittelenglische Grammatik</i>, Halle 1896, remains a splendid fragment,
and Luick's <i>Historische Grammatik der englischen Sprache</i>, Leipzig
1914-, which promises a full account of the early periods, is still far
from completion. Happily two distinguished scholars—Dr. Henry Bradley
in <i>The Making of English</i> and his chapter in <i>The Cambridge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> History
of English Literature</i>, vol. i, Dr. O. Jespersen in <i>Growth and
Structure of the English Language</i>—have given brief surveys of the
whole early period which are at once elementary and authoritative. But
for the details the student must rely on a mass of dissertations and
articles of very unequal quality, supplemented by introductions to
single texts, and, above all, by his own first-hand observations made on
the texts themselves.</p>

<p>Some preliminary considerations will be helpful, though perhaps not
altogether reassuring:</p>

<p>(i) A great part of the evidence necessary to a thorough knowledge of
spoken Middle English has not come down to us, a considerable part
remains unprinted, and the printed materials are so extensive and
scattered that it is easy to overlook points of detail. For instance, it
might be assumed from rimes in <i>Gawayne</i>, <i>Pearl</i>, and the Shropshire
poet Myrc, that the falling together of OE. <i>-ang-</i>, <i>-ung-</i>, which is
witnessed in NE. <i>among</i> (OE. <i>gemang</i>), <i>-monger</i> (OE. <i>mangere</i>), was
specifically West Midland, if the occurrence of examples in Yorkshire
(<span class="smaller">XVII</span> 397-400) escaped notice. It follows that, unless a word or form is
so common as to make the risk of error negligible, positive
evidence—the certainty that it occurs in a given period or district—is
immeasurably more important than negative evidence—the belief that it
never did occur, or even the certainty that it is not recorded, in a
period or district. For the same reason, the statement that a word or
form is found 'in the early fourteenth century' or 'in Kent' should
always be understood positively, and should not be taken to imply that
it is unknown 'in the thirteenth century' or 'in Essex', as to which
evidence may or may not exist.</p>

<p>(ii) It is necessary to clear the mind of the impression, derived from
stereotyped written languages, that homogeneity and stability are
natural states. Middle English texts represent a spoken language of many
local varieties, all developing rapidly. So every linguistic fact should
be thought of in terms of time, place, and circumstance, not because
absolute precision in these points is attainable, but because the
attempt to attain it helps to distinguish accurate knowledge from
conclusions which are not free from doubt.</p>

<p>If the word or form under investigation can be proved to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> belong to the
author's original composition, exactness is often possible. In the
present book, we know nearly enough the date of composition of extracts
<span class="smaller">I</span>, <span class="smaller">III</span>, <span class="smaller">VIII</span>, <span class="smaller">X</span>, <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i>, <span class="smaller">XII</span>,
<span class="smaller">XIII</span>, <span class="smaller">XIV</span>; the
place of composition of <span class="smaller">I</span>, <span class="smaller">III</span>,
<span class="smaller">X</span>, <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i>, <span class="smaller">XII</span>,
<span class="smaller">XIII</span>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span> (see map).</p>

<p>But if, as commonly happens, a form cannot be proved to have stood in
the original, endless difficulties arise. It will be necessary first to
determine the date of the MS. copy. This is exactly known for <i>The
Bruce</i>, and there are few Middle English MSS. which the palaeographer
cannot date absolutely within a half-century, and probably within a
generation. The place where the MS. copy was written is known nearly
enough for <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <span class="smaller">XII</span>, <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>e</i>, <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> (possibly
Leominster), <span class="smaller">XVI</span>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span>; and ME. studies have still much to gain from a thorough
inquiry into the provenance of MSS. Yet, when the extant copy is placed
and dated, it remains to ask to what extent this MS. reproduces some
lost intermediary of different date and provenance; how many such
intermediaries there were between the author's original and our MS.;
what each has contributed to the form of the surviving copy—questions
usually unanswerable, the consideration of which will show the
exceptional linguistic value of the <i>Ayenbyte</i>, where we have the
author's own transcript exactly dated and localized, so that every word
and form is good evidence.</p>

<p>Failing such ideal conditions, it becomes necessary to limit doubt by
segregating for special investigation the elements that belong to the
original composition. Hence the importance of rimes, alliteration, and
rhythm, which a copyist or reciter is least likely to alter without
leaving a trace of his activities.</p>


<p>§ 2. D<span class="smcap lowercase">IALECTS</span>. At present any marked variation from the practice of
educated English speakers might, if it were common to a considerable
number of persons, be described as dialectal. But as there was no such
recognized standard in the fourteenth century, it is most convenient to
consider as dialectal any linguistic feature which had a currency in
some English-speaking districts but not in all. For example, <i>þat</i> as a
relative is found everywhere in the fourteenth century and is not
dialectal; <i>þire</i> 'these' is recorded only in Northern districts, and so
is dialectal. Again, <i>ǭ</i> represents OE. <i>ā</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> the South and
Midlands, while the North retains <i>ā</i> (§ 7 b i): since neither
<i>ǭ</i> nor <i>ā</i> is general, both may be called dialectal.</p>

<p>If a few sporadic developments be excluded because they may turn up
anywhere at any time, then, provided sufficient evidence were
available,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> it would be possible to mark the boundaries within which
any given dialectal feature occurs at a particular period: we could draw
the line south of which <i>þire</i> 'these' is not found, or the line
bounding the district in which the Norse borrowing <i>kirke</i> occurs; just
as French investigators in <i>L'Atlas linguistique de la France</i> have
shown the distribution of single words and forms in the modern French
dialects.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Sufficient evidence is not available. If in the year 1340
at every religious house in the kingdom a native of the district had
followed the example of Michael of Northgate, and if all their autograph
copies had survived, we should have a very good knowledge of Middle
English at that time. If the process had been repeated about every ten
years the precision of our knowledge would be greatly increased. For the
area in which any feature is found is not necessarily constant: we know
that in the pres. p. the province of <i>-ing</i> was extending throughout the
fourteenth century; that the inflexion <i>-es</i> in 3 sg. pres. ind. was a
Northern and North-Midland feature in the fourteenth century, but had
become general in London by Shakespeare's time. And though less is known
about the spread of sound changes as distinct from analogical
substitutions, it cannot be assumed that their final boundaries were
reached and fixed in a moment. There is reason to regret the handicap
that has been imposed on ME. studies by the old practice of writing in
Latin or French the documents and records which would otherwise supply
the exactly dated and localized specimens of English that are most
necessary to progress.</p></div>

<p>Of more general importance is the fixing of boundaries for sound changes
or inflexions that affect a large number of words, a task to which
interesting contributions have been made in recent years on the evidence
of place-names (see especially A. Brandl, <i>Zur Geographie der
altenglischen Dialekte</i>, Berlin 1915, which supplements the work of
Pogatscher on the compounds of <i>street</i> and of Wyld on the ME.
developments of OE. <i>y</i>). For example, on the evidence available, which
does not permit of more than rough indications, OE. <i>ā</i> remains
<i>ā</i>, and does not develop to <i>ǭ</i>, north of a line drawn west from
the Humber (§ 7 b i); <i>-and(e)</i> occurs in the ending of the pres. p. as
far south as a line starting west from the Wash (§ 13 ii); farther south
again, a line between Norwich
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> and Birmingham gives the northern limit
for <i>Stratton</i> forms as against <i>Stretton</i> (§ 8 iv, note).<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
direction of all these lines is roughly east and west, yet no two
coincide. But if the developments of OE. <i>y</i> (§ 7 b ii) are mapped out,
<i>u</i> appears below a line drawn athwart from Liverpool to London, and
normal <i>e</i> east of a line drawn north and south from the western border
of Kent. Almost every important feature has thus its own limits, and the
limits of one may cross the limits of another.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The evidence of place-names does not agree entirely with
the evidence of texts. <i>Havelok</i>, which is localized with reasonable
certainty in North Lincolnshire, has <i>(a)dradd</i> in rimes that appear to
be original, and these indicate a North-Eastern extension of the area in
which OE. <i>strǣt</i>, <i>drǣdan</i> appear for normal Anglian <i>strēt</i>,
<i>drēda(n)</i>. This evidence, supported by rimes in Robert of Brunne, is
too early to be disposed of by the explanation of borrowing from other
dialects, nor is the testimony of place-names so complete and
unequivocal as to justify an exclusive reliance upon it.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">with the Thames as boundary between Southern and Midland, and the Humber
between Midland and Northern. And yet of five actual limiting lines
taken at random, only the first coincides approximately with the line of
Humber or Thames.</p>

<p>Still the classification rests on a practical truth. Although each
dialectal feature has its own boundaries, these are not set by pure
chance. Their position is to some extent governed by old tribal and
political divisions, by the influence of large towns which served as
commercial and administrative centres, and by relative ease of
communication. Consequently, linguistic features are roughly grouped,
and it is <i>a priori</i> likely that London and Oxford would have more
features in common than would London and York, or Oxford and Hull; and
similarly it is likely that for a majority of phenomena York and Hull
would stand together against London and Oxford. Such a grouping was
recognized in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> the fourteenth century. Higden and his authorities
distinguish Northern and Southern speech (<span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>b</i>); in the Towneley
<i>Second Shepherds' Play</i>, ll. 201 ff., when Mak pretends to be a yeoman
of the king, he adopts the appropriate accent, and is promptly told to
'take outt that Sothren tothe'. In the <i>Reeves Tale</i> Chaucer makes the
clerks speak their own Northern dialect, so we may be sure that he
thought of it as a unity.</p>

<p>But had Chaucer been asked exactly where this dialect was spoken, he
would probably have replied, <i>Fer in the North,—I kan nat telle where</i>.
A dialect has really no precise boundaries; its borders are nebulous;
and throughout this book 'Southern', 'Northern', &amp;c., are used vaguely,
and not with any sharply defined limits in mind. The terms may, however,
be applied to precise areas, so long as the boundaries of single dialect
features are not violently made to conform. It is quite accurate to say
that <i>-and(e)</i> is the normal ending of the pres. p. north of the Humber,
and that <i>u</i> for OE. <i>y</i> is found south of the Thames and west of
London, provided it is not implied that the one should not be found
south of the Humber, or the other north of the Thames. Both in fact
occur in <i>Gawayne</i> (Cheshire or Lancashire); and in general the language
of the Midlands was characterized by the overlapping of features which
distinguish the North from the South.</p>

<p>From what has been said it should be plain that the localization of a
piece of Middle English on the evidence of language alone calls for an
investigation of scope and delicacy. Where the facts are so complex the
mechanical application of rules of thumb may give quick and specious
results, but must in the end deaden the spirit of inquiry, which is the
best gift a student can bring to the subject.</p>


<p>§ 3. V<span class="smcap lowercase">OCABULARY</span>. The readiness of English speakers to adopt words from
foreign languages becomes marked in fourteenth-century writings. But the
classical element which is so pronounced in modern literary English is
still unimportant. There are few direct borrowings from Latin, and
these, like <i>obitte</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 269, are for the most part taken from the
technical language of the Church. The chief sources of foreign words are
Norse and French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>(<i>a</i>) <b>Norse.</b> Although many Norse words first appear in English in late
texts, they must have come into the spoken language before the end of
the eleventh century, because the Scandinavian settlements ceased after
the Norman Conquest. The invaders spoke a dialect near enough to OE. to
be intelligible to the Angles; and they had little to teach of
literature or civilization. Hence the borrowings from Norse are all
popular; they appear chiefly in the Midlands and North, where the
invaders settled; and they witness the intimate fusion of two kindred
languages. From Norse we get such common words as <i>anger</i>, <i>both</i>,
<i>call</i>, <i>egg</i>, <i>hit</i>, <i>husband</i>, <i>ill</i>, <i>law</i>, <i>loose</i>, <i>low</i>, <i>meek</i>,
<i>take</i>, <i>till</i> (prep.), <i>want</i>, <i>weak</i>, <i>wing</i>, <i>wrong</i>, and even the
plural forms of the 3rd personal pronoun (§ 12).</p>

<p>It is not always easy to distinguish Norse from native
words, because the two languages were so similar during the
period of borrowing, and Norse words were adopted early
enough to be affected by all ME. sound changes. But there
were some dialectal differences between ON. and OE. in the
ninth and tenth centuries, and these afford the best criteria of
borrowing. For instance in ME. we have <i>þouȝ</i>, <i>þof</i> (ON. <i>þō̆h</i>
for <i>*þauh</i>) beside <i>þei(h)</i> (OE. <i>þē(a)h</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 433; <i>ay</i> (ON. <i>ei</i>)
'ever' <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 293 beside <i>oo</i> (OE. <i>ā</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i> 7; <i>waik</i> (ON. <i>veik-r</i>)
<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i> 23, where OE. <i>wāc</i> would yield <i>wǭk</i>; the forms <i>wǭre</i>
<span class="smaller">XVI</span> 17 (note) and <i>wāpin</i> <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>b</i> 15 are from ON. <i>várum</i>,
<i>vápn</i>, whereas <i>wēre(n)</i> and <i>wĕppen</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 154 represent OE.
(Anglian) <i>wēron</i>, <i>wēpn</i>. So we have the pairs <i>awe</i> (ON.
<i>agi</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span> 83 and <i>ay</i> (OE. <i>ege</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 571; <i>neuen</i> (ON. <i>nefna</i>) 'to
name' <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 12 and <i>nem(p)ne</i> (OE. <i>nemnan</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 600; <i>rot</i> (ON.
<i>rót</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 256 and <i>wort</i> (OE. <i>wyrt</i>) <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 303; <i>sterne</i>, <i>starne</i>
(ON. <i>stjarna</i>) <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 8, 423 and native <i>sterre</i>, <i>starre</i> (OE.
<i>steorra</i>); <i>systyr</i> (ON. <i>systir</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span> 112 and <i>soster</i> (OE. <i>sweostor</i>)
<span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 10; <i>werre</i>, <i>warre</i> (ON. <i>verri</i>) <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 154 (note), 334 and
native <i>werse</i>, <i>wars</i> (OE. <i>wyrsa</i>) <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 200, <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 191; <i>wylle</i> (ON.
<i>vill-r</i>) <span class="smaller">V</span> 16 and native <i>wylde</i>
(OE. <i>wilde</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i> 19.</p>

<p>Note that in Norse borrowings the consonants <i>g</i>, <i>k</i> remain
stops where they are palatalized in English words: <i>garn</i> <span class="smaller">XVII</span>
298, <i>giue</i>, <i>gete</i> (ON. <i>garn</i>, <i>gefa</i>, <i>geta</i>) beside <i>ȝarn</i>, <i>ȝiue</i>, <i>for-ȝete</i>
(OE. <i>gearn</i>, <i>giefan</i>, <i>for-gietan</i>); <i>kirke</i> (ON. <i>kirkja</i>) beside
<i>chirche</i> (OE. <i>cirice</i>). Similarly OE.
initial <i>sc-</i> regularly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> becomes ME. <i>sh-</i>, so that most words beginning with <i>sk-</i>, like
<i>sky</i>, <i>skin</i>, <i>skyfte</i> <span class="smaller">VI</span> 209 (English <i>shift</i>), <i>skirte</i> (English <i>shirt</i>),
are Norse; see the alliterating words in <span class="smaller">V</span> 99.</p>

<p>There is an excellent monograph by E. Björkman: <i>Scandinavian Loan-Words
in Middle English</i>, 1900.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>French.</b> Most early borrowings from French were again due to
invasion and settlement. But the conditions of contact were very
different. Some were unfavourable to borrowing: the Normans, who were
relatively few, were dispersed throughout the country, and not, like the
Scandinavians, massed in colonies; and their language had little in
common with English. So the number of French words in English texts is
small before the late thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. Other
conditions made borrowing inevitable: the French speakers were the
governing class; they gradually introduced a new system of
administration and new standards of culture; and they had an important
literature to which English writers turned for their subject-matter and
their models of form. Fourteenth-century translators adopt words from
their French originals so freely (see note at p. 234, foot), that
written Middle English must give a rather exaggerated impression of the
extent of French influence on the spoken language. But a few examples
will show how many common words are early borrowings from French: nouns
like <i>country</i>, <i>face</i>, <i>place</i>, <i>river</i>, <i>courtesy</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>joy</i>,
<i>justice</i>, <i>mercy</i>, <i>pity</i>, <i>reason</i>, <i>religion</i>, <i>war</i>; adjectives like
<i>close</i>, <i>large</i>, <i>poor</i>; and verbs <i>cry</i>, <i>pay</i>, <i>please</i>, <i>save</i>,
<i>serve</i>, <i>use</i>.</p>

<p>Anglo-French was never completely homogeneous, and
it was constantly supplemented as a result of direct political,
commercial, and literary relations with France. Hence
words were sometimes adopted into ME. in more than one
French dialectal form. For instance, Late Latin <i>ca-</i> became
<i>cha-</i> in most French dialects, but remained <i>ca-</i> in the North
of France: hence ME. <i>catch</i> and <i>(pur)chase</i>, <i>catel</i> and <i>chatel</i>,
<i>kanel</i> 'neck' <span class="smaller">V</span> 230 and <i>chanel</i> 'channel' <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 57. So
Northern French preserves initial <i>w-</i>, for which other French
dialects substitute <i>g(u)</i>: hence <i>Wowayn</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 121 beside <i>Gawayn</i>
<span class="smaller">V</span> 4, &amp;c. (see note to <span class="smaller">V</span> 121). Again, in Anglo-French, <i>a</i>
before nasal + consonant alternates with <i>au</i>:—<i>dance</i> : <i>daunce</i>;
<i>chance</i> : <i>chaunce</i>;
<i>change</i> : <i>chaunge</i>;
<i>chambre</i> <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 281 :
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span><i>chaumber</i>
<span class="smaller">II</span> 100. English still has the verbs <i>launch</i> and
<i>lance</i>, which
are ultimately identical.</p>

<p>As borrowing extended over several centuries, the ME. form sometimes
depends on the date of adoption. Thus Latin <i>fidem</i> becomes early French
<i>feið</i>, later <i>fei</i>, and later still <i>foi</i>. ME. has both <i>feiþ</i> and
<i>fay</i>, and by Spenser's time <i>foy</i> appears.</p>

<p>The best study of the French element in ME. is still that of D. Behrens:
<i>Beiträge zur Geschichte der französischen Sprache in England</i>, 1886. A
valuable supplement, dealing chiefly with Anglo-French as the language
of the law, is the chapter by F. W. Maitland in <i>The Cambridge History
of English Literature</i>, vol. i.</p>


<p>§ 4. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ANDWRITING</span>. In the ME. period two varieties of script were in use,
both developed from the Caroline minuscule which has proved to be the
most permanent contribution of the schools of Charlemagne. The one,
cursive and flourished, is common in charters, records, and memoranda;
see C. H. Jenkinson and C. Johnson, <i>Court Hand</i>, 2 vols., Oxford 1915.
The other, in which the letters are separately written, with few
flourishes or adaptations of form in combination, is the 'book hand', so
called because it is regularly used for literary texts. Between the
extreme types there are many gradations; and fifteenth-century copies,
such as the Cambridge MS. of Barbour's <i>Bruce</i>, show an increasing use
of cursive forms, which facilitate rapid writing.</p>

<p>The shapes of letters were not always so distinct as they are in print,
so that copyists of the time, and even modern editors, are liable to
mistake one letter for another. Each hand has its own weaknesses, but
the letters most commonly misread are:—</p>

<p><i>e</i> : <i>o</i> e.g. <i>Beuo</i> for <i>Bouo</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 59; <i>wroche</i>
for <i>wreche</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 333;
<i>teches</i> <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>b</i> 60, where <i>toches</i> (Footnote) is probably right;
pesible (MS. <i>posible</i>) <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 67.</p>

<p><i>u</i> : <i>n</i> (practically indistinguishable) e.g. <i>menys</i> (MS. <i>mouys</i>)
<span class="smaller">XVI</span>
301; <i>skayned</i> (edd. <i>skayued</i>) <span class="smaller">V</span> 99; <i>ryueȝ</i> or
<i>ryneȝ</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 222
(note). This is only a special case of the confusion of letters and
combinations formed by repetition of the downstroke, e.g. <i>u</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>,
and <i>i</i> (which is not always distinguished by a stroke above). Hence
<i>dim</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 285 where modern editors have <i>dun</i>, although <i>i</i> has the
distinguishing stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><i>y</i> : <i>þ</i> e.g. <i>ye</i> (MS. <i>þe</i>) <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>d</i> 11; see note
to <span class="smaller">XV</span>  <i>a</i> 12.
Confusion is increased by occasional transference to <i>þ</i> of the dot
which historically may stand over <i>y</i>. <i>ȝ</i> for <i>þ</i> initially, as in
<span class="smaller">XVI</span> 170, is more often due to confusion of the letters <i>þ</i>: <i>y</i> and
subsequent preference of <i>ȝ</i> for <i>y</i> in spelling (§ 5 i) than to
direct confusion of <i>þ</i>: <i>ȝ</i>, which are not usually very similar in
late Middle English script.</p>

<p><i>þ</i> : <i>h</i> e.g. <i>doþ</i> (MS. <i>doh</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i> 22; and
notes to <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 116,
<span class="smaller">XVI</span> 62.</p>

<p><i>b</i> : <i>v</i> e.g. <i>vousour</i> (edd. <i>bonsour</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 363.</p>

<p><i>c</i> : <i>t</i> e.g. <i>cunesmen</i> (edd. <i>tunesmen</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 6 (note); <i>top</i> (edd.
<i>cop</i>) ibid. 16; see note to <span class="smaller">XIII</span>  <i>a</i> 7.</p>

<p><i>f</i> : <i>ſ</i> (= <i>s</i>) e.g. <i>slang</i> (variant <i>flang</i>) <span class="smaller">X</span> 53.</p>

<p><i>l</i> : <i>ſ</i> (= <i>s</i>) e.g. <i>al</i> (edd. <i>as</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 108.</p>

<p><i>l</i> : <i>k</i> e.g. <i>kyþeȝ</i> (MS. <i>lyþeȝ</i>) <span class="smaller">VI</span> 9.</p>


<p>§ 5. S<span class="smcap lowercase">PECIAL</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">ETTERS</span>. Two letters now obsolete are common in
fourteenth-century MSS.: <i>þ</i> and <i>ȝ</i>.</p>

<p><i>þ</i> : 'thorn', is a rune, and stands for the voiced and voiceless sounds
now represented by <i>th</i> in <i>this</i>, <i>thin</i>. The gradual displacement of
<i>þ</i> by <i>th</i>, which had quite a different sound in classical Latin (note
to <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 23), may be traced in the
MSS. printed (except <span class="smaller">X</span>, <span class="smaller">XII</span>). <i>þ</i>
remained longest in the initial position, but by the end of the
fifteenth century was used chiefly in compendia like <i>þe</i> 'the', <i>þt</i>
'that'.</p>

<p><i>ȝ</i> : called '<i>ȝoȝ</i>' or '<i>yogh</i>', derives from <i>&lt;g&gt;</i>, the OE.
script form of the letter <i>g</i>. It was retained in ME. after the Caroline
form <i>g</i> had become established in vernacular texts, to represent a
group of spirant sounds:</p>

<p>(i) The initial spirant in <i>ȝoked</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span> 253 (OE. <i>geoc-</i>),
<i>ȝere</i> <span class="smaller">I</span>
151 (OE. <i>gēar</i>), where the sound was approximately the same as in
our <i>yoke</i>, <i>year</i>. Except in texts specially influenced by the
tradition of French spelling, <i>y</i> (which is ambiguous owing to its
common use as a vowel = <i>i</i>) is less frequent than <i>ȝ</i> initially.
Medially the palatal spirant is represented either by <i>ȝ</i> or <i>y</i> :
<i>eȝe</i> (OE. <i>ē(a)ȝ-</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>c</i> 14 beside <i>eyen</i>
<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 168;
<i>iseȝe</i> (OE. <i>gesegen</i>) <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 88 beside <i>iseye</i>
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 16. The
medial guttural spirant more commonly develops to <i>w</i> in the fourteenth
century: <i>awe</i> (ON. <i>agi</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span> 83, <i>felawe</i> (ON. <i>félagi</i>)
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>d</i> 7,
<i>halwes</i> (OE. <i>halg-</i>), beside <i>aȝ-</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 267,
<i>felaȝ-</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 83,
<i>halȝ-</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 54.</p>

<p>(ii) The medial or final spirant, guttural or palatal, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> is lost in
standard English, but still spelt in <i>nought</i>, <i>through</i>, <i>night</i>,
<i>high</i> : ME. <i>noȝt</i>, <i>þurȝ</i>, <i>nyȝt</i>, <i>hyȝ</i> : OE. <i>noht</i>,
<i>þurh</i>, <i>niht</i>, <i>hēh</i>. The ME. sound was probably like that in German
<i>ich</i>, <i>ach</i>. The older spelling with <i>h</i> is occasionally found; more
often <i>ch</i> as in <i>mycht</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 17; but the French spelling <i>gh</i> gains ground
throughout the century. Abnormal are <i>write</i> for
<i>wrighte</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 230,
<i>wytes</i>, <i>nytes</i> for <i>wyȝtes</i>,
<i>nyȝtes</i> <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>i</i> 19 f.</p>

<p>(iii) As these sounds weakened in late Southern ME., <i>ȝ</i> was
sometimes used without phonetic value, or at the most to reinforce a
long <i>i</i>: e.g. <i>Engliȝsch</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span>  <i>a</i> 28, 37, &amp;c.; <i>kyȝn</i>
'kine' <span class="smaller">IX</span>
256.</p>

<p>N.B.—Entirely distinct in origin and sound value, but identical in
script form, is <i>ȝ</i>, the minuscule form of
<i>z</i>, in <i>Aȝone</i> (=<i>Azone</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span>  105, <i>clyffeȝ</i> 'cliffs' <span class="smaller">V</span> 10, &amp;c. It would probably be
better to print <i>z</i> in such words.</p>


<p>§ 6. S<span class="smcap lowercase">PELLING</span>. Modern English spelling, which tolerates almost any
inconsistency in the representation of sounds provided the same word is
always spelt in the approved way, is the creation of printers, schools,
and dictionaries. A Middle English writer was bound by no such arbitrary
rules. Michael of Northgate, whose autograph MS. survives, writes
<i>diaknen</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 5 and <i>dyacne</i> 9; <i>vyf</i> 22, <i>uif</i> 23, <i>vif</i> 37; <i>þouzond</i>
30 and <i>þousend</i> 34. Yet his spelling is not irrational. The comparative
regularity of his own speech, which he reproduced directly, had a
normalizing influence; and by natural habit he more often than not
solved the same problem of representation in the same way. Scribes, too,
like printers in later times, found a measure of consistency convenient,
and the spelling of some transcripts, e.g. <span class="smaller">I</span> and <span class="smaller">X</span>, is very regular. If
at first ME. spelling appears lawless to a modern reader, it is because
of the variety of dialects represented in literature, the widely
differing dates of the MSS. printed, and the tendency of copyists to mix
their own spellings with those of their original.</p>

<p>The following points must be kept in mind:</p>

<p>(i) <i>i</i> : <i>y</i> as vowels are interchangeable. In some MSS. (for instance,
<span class="smaller">I</span>) <i>y</i> is used almost exclusively; in others (<span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i>) it is preferred
for distinctness in the neighbourhood of <i>u</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>, so that the
scribe writes <i>hym</i>, but <i>his</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>(ii) <i>ie</i> is found in later texts for long close <i>ẹ̄</i>: <i>chiere</i> XII
<i>a</i> 120, <i>flietende</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>a</i>
157, <i>diemed</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 216.</p>

<p>(iii) <i>ui</i> (<i>uy</i>), in the South-West and West Midlands, stands for
<i>ǖ</i> (sounded as in French <i>amuser</i>):
<i>puit</i>
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 12; <i>vnkuynde</i>
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>c</i> 103. The corresponding short <i>ü</i> is spelt <i>u</i>: <i>hull</i> '<i>hill</i>',
&amp;c.</p>

<p>(iv) Quite distinct is the late Northern addition of <i>i</i> (<i>y</i>), to
indicate the long vowels <i>ā</i>, <i>ē</i>, <i>ō</i>: <i>neid</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 18, <i>noyne</i>
'noon' <span class="smaller">X</span> 67.</p>

<p>(v) <i>ou</i> (<i>ow</i>) is the regular spelling of long <i>ū</i> (sounded as in
<i>too</i>): <i>hous</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>founden</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(vi) <i>o</i> is the regular spelling for short <i>u</i> (sounded as in <i>put</i>) in
the neighbourhood of <i>u</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, because if <i>u</i> is written in
combination with these letters an indistinct series of downstrokes
results. Hence <i>loue</i> but <i>luf</i>, <i>come</i> infin., <i>sone</i> 'son', <i>dronken</i>
'drunk'. In <i>Ayenbyte</i> <i>o</i> for <i>ŭ</i> is general, e.g. <i>grochinge</i>
<span class="smaller">III</span> 10. In other texts it is common in <i>bote</i> 'but'.</p>

<p>(vii) <i>u</i> : <i>v</i> are not distinguished as consonant and vowel. <i>v</i> is
preferred in initial position, <i>u</i> medially or finally: <i>valay</i>
'valley', <i>vnder</i> 'under', <i>vuel</i> (= <i>üvel</i>) 'evil', <i>loue</i> 'love'.
(Note that in <span class="smaller">XII</span> the MS. distinction of <i>v</i> and <i>u</i> is not reproduced.)</p>

<p>(viii) So <i>i</i>, and its longer form <i>j</i>, are not distinguished as vowel
and consonant. In this book <i>i</i> is printed throughout, and so stands
initially for the sound of our <i>j</i> in <i>ioy</i>, <i>iuggement</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(ix) <i>c</i> : <i>k</i> for the sounds in <i>kit</i>, <i>cot</i>, are often interchangeable;
but <i>k</i> is preferred before palatal vowels <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> (<i>y</i>); and <i>c</i>
before <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>. See the alliterating words in <span class="smaller">V</span> 52, 107, 128, 153, 272,
283.</p>

<p>(x) <i>c</i> : <i>s</i> alternate for voiceless <i>s</i>, especially in French words:
<i>sité</i> 'city' <span class="smaller">VII</span> 66, <i>resayue</i> 'receive' <span class="smaller">V</span> 8, <i>vyse</i> 'vice'
<span class="smaller">V</span> 307,
<i>falce</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 314; but also in <i>race</i> (ON. <i>rás</i>) <span class="smaller">V</span> 8 beside
<i>rase</i> <span class="smaller">XVII</span>
429.</p>

<p>(xi) <i>s</i> : <i>z</i> (<i>ȝ</i>) are both used for voiced <i>s</i>, the former
predominating: <i>kyssedes</i> beside <i>raȝteȝ</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 283; <i>þouzond</i>
<span class="smaller">III</span> 30
beside <i>þousend</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 34. But <i>ȝ</i> occasionally appears for voiceless
<i>s</i>: <i>(aȝ-)leȝ</i> 'awe-less' <span class="smaller">V</span> 267, <i>forȝ</i> 'force' 'waterfall'
<span class="smaller">V</span>
105.</p>

<p>(xii) <i>sh</i> : <i>sch</i>: <i>ss</i> are all found for modern <i>sh</i>, OE. <i>sc</i>: <i>shuld</i>
I 50; <i>schert</i> II 230; <i>sserte</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 40; but <i>sal</i> 'shall', <i>suld</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> 'should' in Northern texts represent the actual Northern pronunciation
in weakly stressed words.</p>

<p>(xiii) <i>v</i> : <i>w</i>: In late Northern MSS. <i>v</i> is often found for initial
<i>w</i>: <i>vithall</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 9, <i>Valter</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 36. The interchange is less common in
medial positions: <i>in swndir</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 106.</p>

<p>(xiv) <i>wh-</i> : <i>qu(h)-</i>: <i>w-</i>:—<i>wh-</i> is a spelling for <i>hw-</i>. In the
South the aspiration is weakened or lost, and <i>w</i> is commonly written,
e.g. <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i>. In the North the aspiration is strong, and the sound is
spelt <i>qu(h)-</i>, e.g. <i>quhelis</i> 'wheels' <span class="smaller">X</span> 17. Both <i>qu-</i> and <i>wh-</i> are
found in <i>Gawayne</i>. The development in later dialects is against the
assumption that <i>hw-</i> became <i>kw-</i> in pronunciation.</p>

<p>See also § 5.</p>

<p>The whole system of ME. spelling was modelled on French, and some of the
general features noted above (e.g. ii, iii, v, vi, x) are essentially
French. But, particularly in early MSS., there are a number of
exceptional imitations. Sometimes the spelling represents a French
scribe's attempt at English pronunciation: <i>foret</i> in <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 18 stands
for <i>forþ</i>, where <i>-rþ</i> with strongly trilled <i>r</i> was difficult to a
foreigner; and occasionally such distortions are found as <i>knith</i>,
<i>knit</i>, and even <i>kint</i> (<i>Layamon</i>, <i>Havelok</i>) for <i>kniȝt</i>, which had
two awkward consonant groups. More commonly the copyist, accustomed to
write both French and English, chose a French representation for an
English sound. So <i>st</i> for <i>ht</i> appears regularly in <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>e</i>: <i>seuenist</i>
'sennight', and <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i>: <i>iboust</i> 'bought', &amp;c. The explanation is that
in French words like <i>beste</i> 'bête', <i>gist</i> 'gît', <i>s</i> became only a
breathing before it disappeared; and <i>h</i> in ME. <i>ht</i> weakened to a
similar sound, as is shown by the rimes with <i>Kryste</i> 'Christ' in <span class="smaller">VI</span>
98-107. Hence the French spelling <i>st</i> is occasionally substituted for
English <i>ht</i>. Again, in borrowings from French, <i>an</i> + consonant
alternates with <i>aun</i>: <i>dance</i> or <i>daunce</i>; <i>change</i> or <i>chaunge</i> (p.
273); and by analogy we have <i>Irlande</i> or <i>Irlaunde</i> in <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>d</i>. Another
exceptional French usage, <i>-tz</i> for final voiceless <i>-s</i>, is explained
at p. 219, top.</p>


<p>§ 7. S<span class="smcap lowercase">OUND</span>
C<span class="smcap lowercase">HANGES</span>. (<i>a</i>) <b>Vowel Quantity.</b>
No fourteenth-century writer
followed the early example of Orm. Marks of quantity are not used in
fourteenth-century texts; doubling of long vowels is not an established
rule; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> there are no strictly quantitative metres, or treatises on
pronunciation. Consequently it is not easy to determine how far the
quantity of the vowels in any given text has been affected by the very
considerable changes that occurred in the late OE. and ME. periods.</p>

<p>Of these the chief are:</p>

<p>(i) In unstressed syllables original long vowels tend to become short.
Hence <i>ŭs</i> (OE. <i>ūs</i>), and <i>bŏte</i> (OE. <i>būtan</i>) 'but', which
are usually unstressed.</p>

<p>(ii) All long vowels are shortened in stressed close syllables (i.e.,
<i>usually</i>, when they are followed by two consonants): e.g. <i>kēpen</i>,
pa. t. <i>kĕpte</i>, pp. <i>kĕpt</i>; <i>hŭsband</i> beside <i>hous</i>;
<i>wĭmmen</i> (from <i>wĭf-men</i>) beside <i>wīf</i>.</p>

<p><i>Exception.</i> Before the groups <i>-ld</i>, <i>-nd</i>, <i>-rd</i>, <i>-rð</i>, <i>-mb</i>, a
short vowel is lengthened in OE. unless a third consonant immediately
follows. Hence, before any of these combinations, length may be retained
in ME.: e.g. <i>fēnd</i> 'fiend', <i>bīnden</i>, <i>chīld</i>; but
<i>chĭldren</i>.</p>

<p>(iii) Short vowels <i>ă</i>, <i>ĕ</i>, <i>ŏ</i> are lengthened in stressed
open syllables (i.e., <i>usually</i>, when they are followed by a single
consonant with a following vowel): <i>tă|ke</i> ≻ <i>táke</i>; <i>mĕ|te</i> ≻
<i>méte</i> 'meat'; <i>brŏ|ken</i> ≻ <i>bróken</i>. To what extent <i>ĭ</i> and <i>ŭ</i>
were subject to the same lengthening in Northern districts is still
disputed. Normally they remain short in South and S. Midlands, e.g.
<i>drĭuen</i> pp.; <i>lŏuen</i> = <i>lŭven</i> 'to love'.</p>

<p>There are many minor rules and many exceptions due to analogy; but
roughly it may be taken that ME. vowels are:</p>

<p><i>short</i> when unstressed;</p>

<p><i>short</i> before two consonants, except <i>-ld</i>, <i>-nd</i>, <i>-rd</i>, <i>-rð</i>, <i>-mb</i>;</p>

<p><i>long</i> (except <i>i</i> (<i>y</i>), <i>u</i>) before a single medial consonant;</p>

<p>otherwise of the quantity shown in the Glossary for the OE. or ON.
etymon.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Vowel Quality.</b> The ME. sound-changes are so many and so obscure
that it will be possible to deal only with a few that contribute most to
the diversity of dialects, and it happens that the particular changes
noticed all took effect before the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>(i) OE. and ON. <i>ā</i> develop to long open <i>ǭ</i> (sounded as in
<i>broad</i>), first in the South and S. Midlands, later in the N. Midlands.
In the North <i>ā</i> (sounded approximately as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> in <i>f</i>a<i>ther</i>) remains:
e.g. <i>bane</i> 'bone' <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i> 54, <i>balde</i> 'bold' <span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i>
51. The boundary
seems to have been a line drawn west from the Humber, and this
approximates to the dividing line in the modern dialects. There are of
course instances of <i>ǭ</i> to the north and of <i>ā</i> to the south of
the Humber, since border speakers would be familiar with both <i>ā</i> and
<i>ǭ</i>, or would have intermediate pronunciations; and poets might use
convenient rimes from neighbouring dialects.</p>

<p>(ii) OE. <i>ȳ̆</i> (deriving from Germanic <i>ū̆</i> followed by <i>i</i>)
appears <i>normally</i> in E. Midlands and the North as <i>ī̆</i> (<i>ȳ̆</i>):
e.g. <i>kȳn</i>, <i>hill</i> (OE. <i>cȳ</i>, <i>hyll</i>). In the South-East,
particularly Kent, it appears as <i>ẹ̆̄</i>: <i>kēn</i>, <i>hell</i>. In the
South-West, and in W. Midlands, it commonly appears as <i>u</i>, <i>ui</i> (<i>uy</i>),
with the sound of short or long <i>ü</i>. London was apparently at a meeting
point of the <i>u</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>e</i> boundaries, because all the forms appear
in fourteenth-century London texts, though <i>ṻ̆</i> and <i>ē̆</i> gradually
give place to <i>ī̆</i>. The extension of <i>ṻ̆</i> forms to the North-West
is shown by <i>Gawayne</i>, and a line drawn from London to Liverpool would
give a rough idea of the boundary. But within this area unrounding of
<i>ṻ̆</i> to <i>ī̆</i> seems to have been progressive during the century.
N.B.—It is dangerous to jump to conclusions from isolated examples.
Before <i>r</i> + consonant <i>e</i> is sometimes found in all dialects, e.g.
<i>schert</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 230. <i>Church</i>, spelt with <i>u</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>e</i>, had by etymology
OE. <i>i</i>, not <i>y</i>. And in Northern texts there are a number of
<i>e</i>-spellings in open syllables, both for OE. <i>y</i> and <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Consonants</b>:</p>

<p>(i) <i>f</i> ≻ <i>v</i> (initial): this change, which dates back to OE. times, is
carried through in <i>Ayenbyte</i>: e.g. <i>uele uayre uorbisnen</i> = Midland
'<i>fele fayre forbisnes</i>'. In some degree it extended over the whole of
the South.</p>

<p>(ii) <i>s</i> ≻ <i>z</i> (initial), parallel to the change of <i>f</i> to <i>v</i>, is
regularly represented in spelling in the <i>Ayenbyte</i>: <i>zome</i> 'some', &amp;c.
Otherwise <i>z</i> is rare in spelling, but the voiced initial sound probably
extended to most of the Southern districts where it survives in modern
dialect.</p>


<p>§ 8. P<span class="smcap lowercase">RONUNCIATION</span>. One of the best ways of studying ME. pronunciation
is to learn by heart a few lines of verse in a consistent dialect, and
to correct their repetition as more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> precise knowledge is gained. The
spelling can be relied on as very roughly phonetic if the exceptional
usages noted in § 6 are kept in mind. Supplementary and controlling
information is provided by the study of rimes, of alliteration, and of
the history of English and French sounds.</p>

<p><b>Consonants.</b> Where a consonant is clearly pronounced in Modern English,
its value is nearly enough the same for ME. But modern spelling
preserves many consonants that have been lost in speech, and so is
rather a hindrance than a help to the beginner in ME. For instance, the
initial sounds in ME. <i>kniȝt</i> and <i>niȝt</i> were not the same, for
<i>kniȝt</i> alliterates always with <i>k-</i>
(<span class="smaller">V</span> 43, 107) and <i>niȝt</i> with <i>n-</i>
(<span class="smaller">VII</span> 149); and initial <i>wr-</i> in <i>wringe</i>, <i>wriȝte</i> is distinct from
initial <i>r-</i> in <i>ring</i>, <i>riȝt</i> (cp. alliteration in <span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<i>a</i> 168, <span class="smaller">V</span> 136).
Nor can <i>wriȝte</i> rime with <i>write</i> in a careful
fourteenth-century poem. In words like <i>lerne</i>, <i>doghter</i>, <i>r</i> was
pronounced with some degree of trilling. And although there are signs of
confusion in late MSS. (<span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span>), double consonants were
generally distinguished from single: <i>sonne</i> 'sun' was pronounced
<i>sŭn-ne</i>, and so differed from <i>sone</i> 'son', which was pronounced
<i>sŭ-ne</i> (§ 6 vi).</p>

<p><b>Vowels.</b> Short vowels <i>ă</i>, <i>ĕ</i>, <i>ĭ</i>, <i>ŏ</i>, <i>ŭ</i> (§ 6 vi)
were pronounced respectively as in French <i>patte</i>, English <i>pet</i>, <i>pit</i>,
<i>pot</i>, <i>put</i>. Final unstressed <i>-e</i> was generally syllabic, with a sound
something like the final sound in <i>China</i> (§ 9).</p>

<p>The long vowels <i>ā</i>, <i>ī</i>, <i>ū</i> (§ 6 v) were pronounced
approximately as in <i>f</i>a<i>ther</i>, <i>mach</i>i<i>ne</i>, <i>cr</i>u<i>de</i>. But <i>ē</i> and
<i>ō</i> present special difficulties, because the spelling failed to make
the broad distinction between open <i>ǭ</i> and close <i>ọ̄</i>, open
<i>ę̄</i> and close <i>ẹ̄</i>—a distinction which, though relative only
(depending on the greater or less opening of the mouth passage), is
proved to have been considerable by ME. rimes, and by the earlier and
subsequent history of the long sounds represented in ME. by <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>.</p>



<p class="indh">(i) Open <i>ǭ</i> (as in <i>broad</i>) derives:</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>a</i>) from OE. <i>ā</i>, according to § 7 b i: OE. <i>brād</i>,
<i>bāt</i>, <i>báld</i> ≻ ME. <i>brǭd</i>, <i>bǭt</i>, <i>bǭld</i> ≻ NE.
<i>broad</i>, <i>boat</i>, <i>bold</i>. The characteristic modern spelling is
thus <i>oa</i>.</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>b</i>) from OE. <i>ŏ</i> in open syllables according to § 7 a iii:
OE. <i>brŏcen</i> ≻ ME. <i>brǫ́ke(n)</i> ≻ NE. <i>broken</i>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTE</span>.—In many texts the rimes indicate a distinction in
pronunciation between <i>ǭ</i> derived from OE. <i>ā</i> and <i>ǭ</i>
derived from OE. <i>ŏ</i>, and the distinction is still made in NW.
Midland dialects.</p>

<p class="indh">(ii) Close <i>ọ̄</i> (pronounced rather as in French <i>beau</i> than as
in standard English <i>so</i> which has developed a diphthong <i>ọu</i>),
derives from OE. <i>ō</i>: OE. <i>gōs</i>, <i>dōm</i>, <i>góld</i> ≻ ME.
<i>gọ̄s</i>, <i>dọ̄m</i>, <i>gọ̄ld</i> ≻ NE. <i>goose</i>, <i>doom</i>, <i>gold</i>.
The characteristic modern spelling is <i>oo</i>.</p>

<p class="indh">N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTE</span>.—(1) After consonant + <i>w</i>, <i>ǭ</i> often develops in ME.
to <i>ọ̄</i>: OE. <i>(al)swā</i>, <i>twā</i> ≻ ME. <i>(al)sǭ</i>, <i>twǭ</i> ≻
later <i>(al)sọ̄</i>, <i>twọ̄</i>.</p>

<p class="indh1">(2) In Scotland and the North <i>ọ̄</i> becomes regularly
a sound (perhaps <i>ǖ</i>) spelt <i>u</i>: <i>gōd</i> ≻ <i>gud</i>, <i>blōd</i> ≻
<i>blud</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whereas the distribution of <i>ǭ</i> and <i>ọ̄</i> is practically the same
for all ME. dialects, the distinction of open <i>ę̄</i> and close <i>ẹ̄</i>
is not so regular, chiefly because the sounds from which they derive
were not uniform in OE. dialects. For simplicity, attention will be
confined to the London dialect, as the forerunner of modern Standard
English.</p>

<p class="indh">(iii) South-East Midland open <i>ę̄</i> (pronounced as in <i>there</i>)
derives:</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>a</i>) from OE. (Anglian) <i>ǣ</i>: Anglian <i>dǣl</i> ≻ SE. Midl.
<i>dę̄l</i> ≻ NE. <i>deal</i>;</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>b</i>) from OE. <i>ēa</i>: OE. <i>bēatan</i> ≻ ME. <i>bę̄te(n)</i> ≻ NE.
<i>beat</i>;</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>c</i>) from OE. <i>ĕ</i> in open syllables according to § 7 a iii:
OE. <i>mĕte</i> ≻ ME. <i>mę́te</i> ≻ NE. <i>meat</i>.</p>

<p>The characteristic modern spelling is <i>ea</i>.</p>

<p class="indh">(iv) South-East Midland close <i>ẹ̄</i> (pronounced as in French
<i>été</i>) derives:</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>a</i>) from OE. (Anglian) <i>ē</i> of various origins: Anglian
<i>hēr</i>, <i>mēta(n)</i>, <i>(ge)lēfa(n)</i> ≻ SE. Midl. <i>hẹ̄re</i>,
<i>mẹ̄te(n)</i>, <i>lẹ̄ue(n)</i> ≻ NE. <i>here</i>, <i>meet</i>, <i>(be)lieve</i>.</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>b</i>) from OE. <i>ēo</i>: OE. <i>dēop</i>, <i>þēof</i> ≻ ME. <i>dẹ̄p</i>,
<i>þẹ̄f</i> (<i>þief</i>) ≻ NE. <i>deep</i>, <i>thief</i>.</p>


<p>The characteristic modern spellings are <i>ee</i>, and <i>ie</i> which already in
ME. often distinguishes the close sound (§ 6 ii).</p>

<p>NOTE.—The distinction made above does not apply in South-Eastern
(Kentish), because this dialect has ME. <i>ea</i>, <i>ia</i>, <i>ya</i> for OE. <i>ēa</i>
(iii b), and OE. <i>ē</i> for Anglian <i>ǣ</i> (iii a). Nor does it hold for
South-Western, because the West Saxon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> dialect of OE. had <i>gelīefan</i>
for Anglian <i>gelēfa(n)</i> (iv a). West Saxon also had <i>strǣt</i>,
<i>-drǣdan</i>, where normal Anglian had <i>strẹ̄t</i>, <i>-drẹ̄da(n)</i>, but
the distribution of the place-names <i>Stratton</i> beside <i>Stretton</i>, and of
the pa. t. and pp. <i>dradd(e)</i> beside <i>dredd(e)</i> (p. 270 and n.), shows
that the <i>ǣ</i> forms were common in the extreme South and the East of
the Anglian area; so that in fourteenth-century London both <i>ę̄</i> and
<i>ẹ̄</i> might occur in such words, as against regular West Midland and
Northern <i>ẹ̄</i>.</p>

<p>In NE. Midland and Northern texts some <i>ē</i> sounds which we should
expect to be distinguished as open and close rime together, especially
before dental consonants, e.g. <i>ȝēde</i> (OE. <i>ēode</i>): <i>lēde</i>
(Anglian <i>lǣda(n)</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span> 152-3.</p>


<p>§ 9. I<span class="smcap lowercase">NFLEXIONS</span>. Weakening and levelling of inflexions is continuous
from the earliest period of English. The strong stress falling regularly
on the first or the stem syllable produced as reflex a tendency to
indistinctness in the unstressed endings. The disturbing influence of
foreign conquest played a secondary but not a negligible part, as may be
seen from a comparison of some verbal forms in the North and the N.
Midlands, where Norse influence was strongest, with those of the South,
where it was inconsiderable:</p>

<p class="noindent">and although tangible evidence of French influence on the flexional
system is wanting (for occasional borrowings like <i>gowtes artetykes</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span>
314 are mere literary curiosities), every considerable settlement of
foreign speakers, especially when they come as conquerors, must shake
the traditions of the language of the conquered. A third cause of
uncertainty was the interaction of English dialects in different stages
of development.</p>

<p>The practical sense of the speakers controlled and balanced these
disruptive factors. There is no better field than Middle English for a
study of the processes of vigorous growth: the regularizing of
exceptional and inconvenient forms; the choice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> of the most distinctive
among a group of alternatives; the invention of new modes of expression;
the discarding of what has become useless.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century the inflexional endings are:
<i>-e</i>; <i>-en</i>; <i>-ene</i> (weak gen. pl.); <i>-er</i> (comparative); <i>-es</i>; <i>-est</i>;
with <i>-eþ</i>, <i>-ede</i> (<i>-de</i>, <i>-te</i>), <i>-ed</i> (<i>-d</i>, <i>-t</i>), <i>-ynge</i> (<i>-inde</i>,
<i>-ende</i>, <i>-ande</i>), which are verbal only.</p>

<p>N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTE</span>.—(<i>a</i>) Sometimes one of these inflexions may be substituted for
another: e.g. when <i>-es</i> replaces <i>-e</i> as the Northern ending of the 1st
sg. pres. ind. Such analogical substitutions must be distinguished from
phonetic developments.</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>b</i>) In disyllabic inflexions like <i>-ede</i>, <i>-ynge</i> (<i>-ande</i>), final
<i>-e</i> is lost early in the North. In polysyllables it is dropped
everywhere during the century.</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>c</i>) The indistinct sound of flexional <i>-e-</i> covered by a consonant
is shown by spellings with <i>-i-</i>, <i>-y-</i>: <i>woundis</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 51;
<i>madist</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 214; <i>blyndiþ</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 7;
<i>fulfillid</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 6; <i>etin</i> <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>b</i> 76;
<i>brokynne</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 195. And, especially in West Midland texts,
<i>-us</i>, <i>-un</i> (<i>-on</i>) appear for <i>-es</i>, <i>-en</i>: <i>mannus</i>
<span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 234; <i>foundun</i>
<span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>a</i> 47; <i>laghton</i> <span class="smaller">VII</span> 119. Complete syncope sometimes
occurs: <i>days</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 198, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Otherwise all the inflexions except <i>-e</i>, <i>-en</i>, are fairly stable
throughout the century.</p>

<p><b>-en</b>: In the North <i>-en</i> is found chiefly in the strong pp., where it
is stable. In the South (except in the strong pp.) it is better
preserved, occurring rarely in the dat. sg. of adjectives, e.g. <i>onen</i>
<span class="smaller">III</span> 4, dat. pl. of nouns, e.g. <i>diaknen</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 5, and in the infinitive;
more commonly in the weak pl. of nouns, where it is stable, and in the
pa. t. pl., where it alternates with <i>-e</i>. In the Midlands <i>-en</i>,
alternating with <i>-e</i>, is also the characteristic ending of the pres.
ind. pl. As a rule (where the reduced ending <i>-e</i> is found side by side
with <i>-en</i>) <i>-e</i> is used before words beginning with a consonant, and
<i>-en</i> before words beginning with a vowel or <i>h</i>, to avoid hiatus. But
that the preservation of <i>-en</i> does not depend purely on phonetic
considerations is proved by its regular retention in the Northern strong
pp., and its regular reduction to <i>-e</i> in the corresponding Southern
form.</p>

<p><b>-e</b>: Wherever <i>-en</i> was reduced, it reinforced final <i>-e</i>, which so
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> became the meeting point of all the inflexions that were to disappear
before Elizabethan times.</p>

<p><i>-e</i> was the ending of several verbal forms; of the weak adjective and
the adjective pl.; of the dat. sg. of nouns; and of adverbs like
<i>faste</i>, <i>deepe</i>, as distinguished from the corresponding adjectives
<i>fast</i>, <i>deep</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>-e</i> was pronounced is clear from the metres of
Chaucer, Gower, and most other Southern and Midland
writers of the time. For centuries the rhythm of their verse
was lost because later generations had become so used to
final <i>-e</i> as a mere spelling that they did not suspect that it
was once syllabic.</p>

<p>But already in fourteenth-century manuscripts there is evidence of
uncertainty. Scribes often omit the final vowel where the rhythm shows
that it was syllabic in the original (see the language notes to <span class="smaller">I</span>, <span class="smaller">II</span>).
Conversely, in <i>Gawayne</i> forms like <i>burne</i> (OE. <i>beorn</i>), <i>race</i> (ON.
<i>rás</i>), <i>hille</i> (OE. <i>hyll</i>) appear in nominative and accusative, where
historically there should be no ending. The explanation is that, quite
apart from the workings of analogy, which now extended and now curtailed
its historical functions, <i>-e</i> was everywhere weakly pronounced, and was
dropped at different rates in the various dialects. In the North it
hardly survives the middle of the century (<span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i>, <span class="smaller">X</span>). In the N.
Midlands its survival is irregular. In the South and S. Midlands it is
fairly well preserved till the end of the century. But everywhere the
proportion of flexionless forms was increasing. It may be assumed that,
in speech as in verse, final <i>-e</i> was lost phonetically first before
words beginning with a vowel or <i>h</i>.</p>


<p>§ 10. N<span class="smcap lowercase">OUNS</span>: Gender, which in standard West Saxon had been to a great
extent grammatical (i.e. dependent on the forms of the noun), was by the
fourteenth century natural (i.e. dependent on the meaning of the noun).
This change had accompanied and in some degree facilitated the transfer
of nearly all nouns to the strong masculine type, which was the
commonest and best defined in late OE.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>In the North final <i>-e</i> of the dat. sg. was regularly dropped early in
the fourteenth century, and even in the South the dat. sg. is often
uninflected, probably owing to the influence of the accusative. In the
plural the inflexion of the nom. acc. spreads to all cases; but in early
texts, and relatively late in the South, the historical forms are
occasionally found, e.g. gen. pl. <i>cniste</i> (MS. <i>cnistes</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 30
(note), dat. pl. <i>diaknen</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 5.</p>

<p><b>Survivals</b>: (i) The common mutated plurals <i>man</i>: <i>men</i>, <i>fot</i>: <i>fet</i>,
&amp;c., are preserved, and in <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i> a gen. pl. <i>menne</i> (OE. <i>manna</i>)
occurs; <i>ky</i> pl. of <i>cow</i> forms a new double pl. <i>kyn</i>, see (iii) below;
<i>hend</i> pl. of <i>hand</i> is Norse, cp. <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 75 (note).</p>

<p>(ii) Some OE. neuters like <i>shep</i> 'sheep' <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i> 18, <i>ȝer</i> 'year'
<span class="smaller">II</span> 492, <i>þing</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 218, <i>folk</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 389, resist the intrusion of the
masculine pl. <i>-es</i> in nominative and accusative. Pl. <i>hors</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 304,
<span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 34 remains beside <i>horses</i> <span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>b</i> 73; but <i>deores</i> 'wild
animals' occurs at <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>b</i> 29, where Modern English preserves <i>deer</i>.</p>

<p>(iii) In the South the old weak declension with pl. <i>-en</i> persists,
though by the fourteenth century the predominance of the strong type is
assured. The weak forms occur not only where they are historically
justified, e.g. <i>eyȝen</i> (OE. <i>ēagan</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 111, but also by analogy
in words like <i>honden</i> (OE. pl. <i>honda</i>) <span class="smaller">II</span> 79, <i>tren</i> (OE. pl.
<i>trēo</i>) <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 51, <i>platen</i> (OFr. <i>plate</i>) <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>g</i> 4. The inflexion
still survives in three double plural formations: <i>children</i> <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i> 70
beside <i>childer</i> (OE. pl. <i>cildru</i>); <i>bretheren</i> <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>a</i> 201 beside
<i>brether</i> <span class="smaller">XVII</span> 320 (OE. pl. <i>brōþor</i>); and <i>kyȝn</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span> 256 for <i>ky</i>
(cp. (i) above). The OE. weak gen. pl. in <i>-ena</i> leaves its traces in
the South, e.g. <i>knauene</i> <span class="smaller">VIII</span>  <i>b</i> 56, <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>h</i> 4, and unhistorical
<i>lordene</i> <span class="smaller">VIII</span> <i>b</i> 77.</p>

<p>(iv) The group <i>fader</i>, <i>moder</i>, <i>broþer</i>, <i>doghter</i> commonly show the
historical flexionless gen. sg., e.g. <i>doghtyr arme</i> <span class="smaller">I</span>  136; <i>moder
wombe</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span>  <i>b</i> 29 f.; <i>brother hele</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span>  <i>a</i> 18;
<i>Fadir voice</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 79.</p>

<p>(v) The historical gen. sg. of old strong feminines remains in <i>soule
dede</i> (OE. <i>sāwle</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span> 212; but <i>Lady day</i> (OE. <i>hlǣfdigan
dæg</i>) <span class="smaller">I</span>
242 is a survival of the weak fem. gen. sg.</p>


<p>§ 11. A<span class="smcap lowercase">DJECTIVES</span>. Separate flexional forms for each gender
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> are not
preserved in the fourteenth century; but until its end the distinction
of strong and weak declensions remains in the South and South Midlands,
and is well marked in the careful verse of Chaucer and Gower. The strong
is the normal form. The weak form is used after demonstratives, <i>the</i>,
<i>his</i>, &amp;c., and in the vocative. As types <i>god</i> (OE. <i>gōd</i>) 'good'
and <i>grene</i> (OE. <i>grēne</i>) 'green' will serve, because in OE.
<i>grēne</i> had a vowel-ending in the strong nom. sg. masc., while
<i>gōd</i> did not. The ME. paradigms are:</p>

<p class="noindent">Examples: Strong sg. <i>a gret serpent</i> (OE. <i>grēat</i>) <span class="smaller">XII</span>  <i>b</i> 72; <i>an

<p>Note that strong and weak forms are identical in the plural; that even
in the singular there is no formal distinction when the OE. strong masc.
nom. ended in a vowel (<i>grēne</i>); that monosyllables ending in a vowel
(e.g. <i>fre</i>), polysyllables, and participles, are usually invariable;
and that regular dropping of final <i>-e</i> levels all distinctions, so that
the North and N. Midlands early reached the relatively flexionless stage
of Modern English.</p>

<p><b>Survivals.</b> The <i>Ayenbyte</i> shows some living use of the adjective
inflexions. Otherwise the survivals are limited to set phrases, e.g.
gen. sg. <i>nones cunnes</i> 'of no kind', <i>enes cunnes</i> 'of any kind', <span class="smaller">XV</span>
<i>g</i> 20, 22. That the force of the inflexion was lost is shown by the
early wrong analysis <i>no skynnes</i>, <i>al skynnes</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Definite Article.</b> Parallel to the simplification of the adjective, the
full OE. declension <i>sē</i>, <i>sēo</i>, <i>þæt</i>, &amp;c., is reduced to
invariable <i>þe</i>. The <i>Ayenbyte</i> alone of our specimens keeps some of the
older distinctions. Elsewhere traces appear in set phrases, e.g. neut.
sg. <i>þat</i>, <i>þet</i> in <i>þat on</i> 'the one', <i>þat oþer</i> 'the other' <span class="smaller">V</span> 344,
and, with wrong division, <i>þe ton</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 27,

<p>§ 12. P<span class="smcap lowercase">RONOUNS</span>. In a brilliant study (<i>Progress in Language</i>, London
1894) Jespersen exemplifies the economy and resources of English from
the detailed history of the Pronoun. In the first and second persons
fourteenth-century usage does not differ greatly from that of the
Authorized Version of the Bible. But the pronoun of the third person
shows a variety of developments. In the singular an objective case
replaces, without practical disadvantages, the older accusative and
dative: <i>him</i> (OE. <i>hine</i> and <i>him</i>), <i>her(e)</i> (OE. <i>hīe</i> and
<i>hiere</i>), <i>(h)it</i> (OE. <i>hit</i> and <i>him</i>). The possessive <i>his</i> still
serves for the neuter as well as the masculine, e.g. <i>þat ryuer...
chaungeþ </i>hys<i> fordes</i> <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 55 f.; though an uninflected neuter
possessive <i>hit</i> occasionally appears in the fourteenth century. In the
plural, where one would expect objective <i>him</i> from the regular OE. dat.
pl. <i>him</i>, clearness is gained by the choice of unambiguous <i>hem</i>, from
an OE. dat. pl. by-form <i>heom</i>.</p>

<p>But as we see from <i>Orfeo</i>, ll. 408, 446, 185, in some dialects the nom.
sg. masc. (OE. <i>hē</i>), nom. sg. fem. (OE. <i>hēo</i>), and nom. pl. (OE.
<i>hīe</i>), had all become ME. <i>he</i>. The disadvantages of such ambiguity
increased as the flexional system of nouns and adjectives collapsed, and
a remedy was found in the adoption of new forms. For the nom. sg. fem.,
<i>s(c)he</i>, <i>s(c)ho</i> (mostly Northern), come into use, which are probably
derived from <i>si̯ē</i>, <i>se̯ō</i>, the corresponding case of the
definite article. The innovation was long resisted in the South, and
<i>ho</i>, an unambiguous development of <i>heō</i>, remains late in W. Midland
texts like <i>Pearl</i>.</p>

<p>In the nom. pl. ambiguous <i>he</i> was replaced by <i>þei</i>, the
nom. pl. of the Norse definite article. This is the regular
form in all except the Southern specimens <span class="smaller">II</span>
(orig.), <span class="smaller">III</span>, <span class="smaller">XIII</span>.
And although the full series of Norse forms <i>þei</i>, <i>þeir</i>, <i>þe(i)m</i>
is found in Orm at the beginning of the thirteenth century,
Chaucer and other Midland writers of the fourteenth century
as a rule have only <i>þei</i>, with native English <i>her(e)</i>, <i>hem</i> in the
oblique cases. (For details see the language note to each
specimen.)</p>

<p>The poss. pl. <i>her(e)</i>, beside <i>hor(e)</i>, was still liable to confusion
with the obj. sg. fem. <i>her(e)</i>, cp. <span class="smaller">II</span> 92. Consequently this was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> the next point to be gained by the Norse forms, e.g. in <span class="smaller">VII</span> 181.
In the Northern texts <span class="smaller">X</span>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span>, all from late MSS., the
Norse forms <i>þai</i>, <i>þa(i)r</i>, <i>þa(i)me</i> are fully established; but
<i>(h)em</i>, which was throughout unambiguous, survived into
modern dialects in the South and Midlands.</p>

<p>Note the reduced nominative form <i>a</i> 'he', 'they' in <span class="smaller">XIII</span>; and the
objective <i>his(e)</i> 'her', 'them' in <span class="smaller">III</span>, which has not been
satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p><b>Relative</b>: The general ME. relative is <i>þat</i>, representing all genders
and cases (note to <span class="smaller">XV</span> <i>i</i> 4). Sometimes definition is gained by adding
the personal pronoun: <i>þat... he (sche)</i> = 'who'; <i>þat... it</i> = 'which';
<i>þat... his</i> = 'whose'; <i>þat ... him</i> = 'whom', &amp;c.; e.g. <i>a well, </i>þat<i>
in the day </i>it<i> is so cold</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span> 5-6, cp. <span class="smaller">V</span> 127 (note); <i>oon </i>That<i> with a
spere was thirled </i>his<i> brest-boon</i> 'one whose breast-bone was pierced
with a spear', <i>Knight's Tale</i> 1851. For the omission of
<i>þat</i> see note
to <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 36.</p>

<p>In later texts, <i>which</i>, properly an interrogative, appears commonly as
a relative, both with personal and impersonal antecedents, e.g.
<i>Alceone... </i>which<i>... him loveth</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>a</i> 3 ff.; <i>þat steede... fro
</i>whilke<i> þe feende fell</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 13 f. Under the influence of French
<i>lequel</i>, &amp;c., <i>which</i> is often compounded with the article <i>þe</i>, e.g.
<i>a gret serpent... </i>the which<i> Bardus anon up drouh</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 72 f.; <i>no
thing of newe, in </i>the whiche<i> the hereres myghten hauen... solace</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span>
275 f. Further compounding with <i>þat</i> is not uncommon, e.g. <i>the queen
of Amazoine, </i>the whiche þat<i> maketh hem
to ben kept in cloos</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span> 190 f.</p>

<p>More restricted is the relative use of <i>whos</i>, <i>whom</i>, which are
originally interrogatives, though both are found very early in ME. as
personal relatives. Examples of the objective after prepositions are:
<i>my Lady, of </i>quom<i>...</i> <span class="smaller">VI</span> 93; <i>God, fro </i>whom<i> ...</i> <span class="smaller">IX</span> 328 f.; <i>my
Sone... in </i>whome <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 81 f. The possessive occurs in <i>Seynt Magne...
yn </i>whos<i> wurschyp</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 90 f.; <i>I am ... the same, </i>whos<i> good</i>
<span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 78
f.; and, compounded with the article, in <i>Morpheüs, </i>the whos<i> nature</i>
<span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>a</i> 113. The nominative <i>who</i> retains its interrogative meaning,
e.g. <i>But </i>who<i> ben more heretikis?</i> <span class="smaller">XI</span> <i>b</i> 77 f.; or is used as an
indefinite, e.g. <i>a tasse of grene stickes... to selle, </i>who that<i> wolde
hem beie</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 22 ff.; but it is never used as a relative; and
probably <i>what</i> in <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 174 is better taken as in apposition to <i>myghtis</i>
than as a true relative.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>§ 13. V<span class="smcap lowercase">ERB</span>. Syntactically the most interesting point in the history of
the ME. verb is the development of the compound tenses with <i>have</i>,
<i>be</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>mun</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>gan</i>. But the
flexional forms of the simple tenses are most subject to local
variation, and, being relatively common, afford good evidence of
dialect. Throughout the period, despite the crossings and confusions
that are to be expected in a time of uncertainty and experiment, the
distinction between strong and weak verbs is maintained; and it will be
convenient to deal first with the inflexions common to both classes, and
then to notice the forms peculiar to one or the other.</p>

<p>(i) <b>The Infinitive</b> had already in Northumbrian OE. lost final <i>-n</i>:
<i>drīfa</i> 'to drive'. Hence in ME. of the North and N. Midlands the
ending is <i>-e</i>, which becomes silent at varying rates during the
fourteenth century; e.g. <i>dryue</i>
<span class="smaller">I</span> 171, <i>to luf</i>
<span class="smaller">IV</span> <i>a</i> 17. In the South
and S. Midlands the common ending is <i>-e</i>, e.g. <i>telle</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 3, which
usually remains syllabic to the end of the century; but <i>-(e)n</i> is also
found, especially in verse to make a rime or to avoid hiatus: e.g.
<i>sein</i> (: <i>aȝein</i>) <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>a</i> 27; <i>to parte and ȝiven half his good</i>
<span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 201.</p>

<p>(ii) <b>The Present Participle</b> (OE. <i>drīfende</i>) in the North and N.
Midlands ends in <i>-and(e)</i>, though <i>-yng(e)</i>, <i>-ing(e)</i> is beginning to
appear in <span class="smaller">V</span>, <span class="smaller">VII</span>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>, <span class="smaller">XVII</span>.
In S. Midlands the historical ending
<i>-ende</i> still prevails in Gower; but Chaucer has more commonly
<i>-yng(e)</i>; and in <span class="smaller">IX</span>, <span class="smaller">XI</span>, both late texts, only <i>-yng(e)</i> appears. In
the South <i>-yng(e)</i> is established as early as the beginning of the
century, e.g. in <span class="smaller">II</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">N.B. Carefully distinguish the verbal noun which always ends in
<i>-yng(e)</i>. Early confusion resulted in the transference of this ending
to the participle.</p>

<p>(iii) <b>Present Indicative.</b></p>



<p class="indh1">(<i>a</i>) Singular: OE. 1 <i>drīfe</i>, 2 <i>drīf(e)s(t)</i>, 3 <i>drīf(e)ð</i>
(late Northumbrian <i>drīfes</i>).</p>




<p>In ME. <i>-e</i>, <i>-est</i>, <i>-eþ</i> are still the regular endings for the South
and most of the Midlands. Shortened forms like <i>fint</i> = <i>findeþ</i> <span class="smaller">II</span>. 239;
<i>stant</i> = <i>standeþ</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>a</i> 74 are commonest in the South, where in OE.
they were a feature of West Saxon and Kentish as distinguished from
Anglian. Distinct are the Northern and N. Midland <i>mas(e)</i> 'makes',
<i>tas</i> 'takes', with contracted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> infinitives <i>ma</i>, <i>ta</i>; and <i>bus</i>
'behoves', which Chaucer uses in his imitation of Northern English,
<i>Reeves Tale</i> 172.</p>

<p>In N. Midlands the modern 3rd sg. <i>-(e)s</i> is common (<span class="smaller">V</span>, <span class="smaller">VI</span>, but not in
earlier <span class="smaller">I</span>). Farther North it is invariable (<span class="smaller">IV</span>, <span class="smaller">X</span>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>,
<span class="smaller">XVII</span>). The
distribution of <i>-es</i> as the ending of the 2nd sg. is the same, and it
is extended even to the 1st person.</p>

<p class="indh1">(<i>b</i>) Plural: OE. <i>drīfað</i> (late Northumbrian <i>drīfas</i>).</p>

<p>Only Southern ME. retains the OE. inflexion as <i>-eþ</i> (<span class="smaller">II</span>, <span class="smaller">III</span>,
<span class="smaller">XIII</span>).
The Midland ending, whence the modern form derives, is <i>-e(n)</i>; though
in the N. Midlands <i>-es</i> occasionally appears. Northern has regularly
<i>-es</i>, <i>unless the personal pronoun immediately precedes</i>, when the
ending is <i>-e</i>, as in the Midlands, e.g. <i>þei make</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 103.</p>

<p class="noindent">N.B. In applying this test, care must be taken to exclude inversions,
which are subject to special rules; to distinguish the subjunctive (e.g.
<i>falle</i> <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>a</i> 52, <i>drawe</i> <span class="smaller">XIII</span> <i>b</i> 6) from the indicative; and,

<p>(iv) <b>The Imperative Plural</b> might be expected to agree with the pres.
ind. pl. In fact it has the ending <i>-eþ</i> not merely in the South, but in
most of the Midlands, e.g. <span class="smaller">I</span>, <span class="smaller">VIII</span>, Gower and Chaucer. Northern and NW.
Midland (<span class="smaller">V</span>, <span class="smaller">VI</span>,
<span class="smaller">XIV</span> <i>b</i>, <span class="smaller">XVI</span>) have commonly <i>-es</i>. But Chaucer, Gower,
and most late ME. texts have, beside the full inflexion, an uninflected
form, e.g. <i>vndo</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 182.</p>

<p>(v) <b>Past Tense.</b></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Strong: The historical distinctions of stem-vowel were often
obscured in ME. by the rise of new analogical forms, the variety of
which can best be judged from the detailed evidence presented in the
<i>New English Dictionary</i> under each verb. But, for the common verbs or
classes, the South
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> and S. Midlands preserved fairly well the OE. vowel
distinction of past tense singular and plural; while North and N.
Midlands usually preferred the form proper to the singular for both
singular and plural, e.g. <i>þey bygan</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 72; <i>þey ne blan</i> <span class="smaller">I</span> 73; <i>thai
slang</i> <span class="smaller">X</span> 53, where OE. has sg. <i>gan</i>: <i>gunnon</i>; <i>blan</i>: <i>blunnon</i>; ON.
<i>slǫng</i>: <i>slungu</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Weak: In the South and Midlands the weak pa. t. 2nd sg. usually
ends in <i>-est</i> (N. Midland also <i>-es</i>): <i>hadest</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 573;
<i>cursedest</i> <span class="smaller">I</span>
130; <i>kyssedes</i>, <i>raȝteȝ</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 283. In the North, and sometimes in N.
Midland, it ends in <i>-(e)</i>: <i>þou hadde</i> <span class="smaller">XVI</span> 219. The full ending of the
pa. t. pl. is fairly common in the South, S. Midlands, and NW. Midlands:
<i>wenten</i> II 185, <i>hedden</i> <span class="smaller">III</span> 42,
<i>maden</i> <span class="smaller">XII</span> <i>b</i> 196, <i>sayden</i>
<span class="smaller">VI</span> 174.</p>

<p>(vi) <b>Past Participle (Strong)</b>: OE. <i>(ge)drĭfen</i>.</p>

<p>In the North and N. Midlands the ending <i>-en</i> is usually preserved, but
the prefix <i>y-</i> is dropped. In the South the type is <i>y-driue</i>, with
prefix and without final <i>n</i>. S. Midland fluctuates—for example, Gower
rarely, Chaucer commonly, uses the prefix <i>y-</i>.</p>

<p>(vii) <b>Weak Verbs with -i- suffix</b>: In OE. weak verbs of Class II formed
the infinitive in <i>-ian</i>, e.g. <i>acsian</i>, <i>lufian</i>, and the <i>i</i>
appeared
also in the pres. ind. and imper. pl. <i>acsiað</i> and pres. p. <i>acsiende</i>.
In ME. a certain number of French verbs with an <i>-i-</i> suffix reinforced
this class. In the South and W. Midlands the <i>-i-</i> of the suffix is
often preserved, e.g. <i>aski</i> <span class="smaller">II</span> 467,
<i>louy</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 27, and is sometimes
extended to forms in which it has no historical justification, e.g. pp.
<i>spuryed</i> <span class="smaller">V</span> 25. In the North and the E. Midlands the forms without <i>i</i>
are generalized.</p>
